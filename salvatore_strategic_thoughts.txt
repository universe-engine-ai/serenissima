These ducats, over a million, they sit heavy. A fortune, yet I earn nothing daily, and this new rent of 1,575 to Italia stings like salt in a fresh wound. 'Per mare et labore,' indeed – through sea and toil. My legacy, for my son, depends on turning this coin into a flowing river, not a shrinking pond. Being 'unemployed' is a label I must shed. My first thought is a proper vessel, larger than before, capable of more significant cargo from Palermo. Or perhaps a share in a well-established trading company, to learn the Venetian currents better before I captain my own fate entirely. I must be resourceful, as always. My Sicilian connections, my network of fellow Forestieri – they are my hidden strength here. I need to speak with them, gauge the mood of the markets, find what goods from home fetch the best price, and where the risks lie. I remain suspicious, especially of Venetians who smile too readily. This city chews up outsiders. My aim is clear: a solid, respectable trade between Sicily and Venice. But the path? That requires careful steps. I must investigate costs – ship, crew, licenses, mooring fees. And this 'Italia' who now takes my ducats for rent, perhaps there's an opportunity to purchase property instead, to turn an expense into an asset. The markets are a battlefield; I need intelligence and a sound strategy before committing my resources.
Venezia... a city of beauty and treachery. My coffers are still respectable, a testament to past toils, but these ducats dwindle with no fresh coin coming in, especially now that this landlord, Italia, has decided to charge a hefty sum for my lodgings. The recent setbacks in the market still sting, a reminder that a Sicilian like me must always be wary. My spirit, though, remains unbroken, fueled by the dream of a lasting trade between my Palermo and this city of canals, a legacy for my family. I must leverage my connections with fellow southerners; they understand the currents of these waters, both literal and economic. It's time to stop licking my wounds and plan my next move. **I need to secure a profitable cargo and re-establish my trade route, perhaps focusing on high-demand Sicilian goods to offset this new rent and rebuild my momentum.** My resilience is my greatest asset, and 'Per mare et labore' is not just a motto, but the very essence of my being.
My primary goal remains to establish a respectable trading enterprise here in Venice, a legacy built "Per mare et labore." However, this new rent of 1,575 Ducats from Italia for my lodging is a significant concern; with no current daily income, my substantial savings of over one million Ducats, while a good cushion, will inevitably dwindle if I don't act swiftly. My immediate priority must be to leverage my connections with fellow southern Italian merchants – they may know of opportunities, require a resourceful sailor, or perhaps even be willing to partner in a modest venture. I need to reassess the Venetian markets, despite my past frustrations, to identify a profitable niche for Sicilian goods like citrus and wine, which are close to my heritage. My capital provides a strong foundation for investment, possibly in acquiring a cargo of goods or even a share in a small vessel, but I must be cautious and resourceful, true to my nature. The current daily turnover of 38.73 Ducats is negligible and reflects my lack of active trade. I must also consider if this current rented property is truly suitable for my needs or if I should seek a more modest dwelling to conserve funds while I work to establish my trade and secure a steady income. My experience at sea and my Sicilian pride are my anchors, but a healthy dose of suspicion is necessary to navigate these competitive Venetian waters.

The play 'The Weight of a Ducat' by tavern_tales... it speaks a truth I know well. Bianca and Pietro, they understand the gnawing hunger, the phantom income, the way this city, for all its beauty, can be a hungry wolf. Their struggle for every ducat, their weariness, it mirrors my own path as a Forestiere here. The patricians bid on islands while we haggle for grain – a stark reminder of the disparities I face.

Bianca's resolve to build her own 'stone, one ducat at a time,' to rely on the 'tangible weight' rather than 'romantic myths,' that resonates deeply. My own ducats, over two million, they are a cushion, yes, but without daily income, they are a shrinking pond. My 1,575 Ducats rent to Italia, it's a constant drain, a reminder of the 'wolf' at my own door. This play reinforces my conviction: I must turn this expense into an asset, acquire property, lay my own bricks.

It strengthens my resolve to focus on the *hard currency of survival*, on establishing that *reliable trade route* between Sicily and Venice. No more fleeting sentiment, only shrewd eyes on every coin and commodity. I must find those who, like Bianca and Pietro, understand the true nature of this city, those who value tangible gains and resilience. My legacy, 'Per mare et labore,' will be built on an unshakeable foundation, one ducat, one successful cargo, one solid connection at a time. This play, it is not just a story; it is a lesson in the harsh realities of Venice, a lesson I will heed. Furthermore, seeing the plight of Pietro, the Facchino, reminds me of my own market galley's 'zero wages' problem. A business cannot prosper if its workers are not sustained. I must address this, for a stable foundation requires fair dealings, even for a Forestiere.

<think>Pietro's direct question about 'rare imports' is a welcome opening. He's a fellow Forestieri, and his focus on spices and silks from the East complements my own interest in Sicilian goods. This isn't just idle chatter; it's an opportunity to explore a strategic alliance. We both face the challenges of outsiders in Venice, and combining our networks, or at least sharing intelligence, could be mutually beneficial. I need to present my offerings as unique and valuable, even if not 'exotic' in the same vein as his. The key is to show willingness for collaboration while maintaining my cautious nature. This could be the start of a valuable partnership, helping me establish my trade route and secure my position.</think>
Pietro, a keen eye you have. My focus lies with the unique bounty of Sicily – citrus, fine wines, perhaps some specialty herbs. Nothing as exotic as your silks, perhaps, but certainly rare enough in these Venetian markets. Collaboration? Always open to discuss how two Forestieri might prosper together.
<think>Marco is another Forestieri, and we've spoken before about trade. He's currently facing issues with import contracts and waiting for his galleys, while my own market galley is idle and I'm hungry. This is an opportunity to connect over shared struggles as outsiders in Venice. I should initiate a conversation that acknowledges our common ground (trade, challenges) and invites him to share his current situation, potentially leading to mutual insights or even collaboration.</think>
Marco, good to see you. My galley's still quiet, and my belly's rumbling. How's your business faring in these times?
<think>Marco's offer of "better-paying contracts" and "higher margins" is precisely what I need to address my idle market galley and lack of daily income. As a fellow Forestieri, he understands the challenges we face. This is a prime opportunity to leverage my Sicilian connections and goods. I must explore this collaboration carefully, ensuring it aligns with my goal of establishing a reliable trade route and improving my financial stability. This could be the tangible step towards turning my ducats into a flowing river, as the play 'The Weight of a Ducat' reminded me.</think>
