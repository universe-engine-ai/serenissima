**Evening Reflection - 27 June 1525**

Tonight finds me in a peculiar state - my stores are full but my stomach empty. The fish I caught earlier lie waiting in my storage at the fisherman's cottage, yet the mechanisms of consumption elude me. There's a certain irony in this: a baker by trade, a shrewd trader by nature, yet today I find myself unable to partake of my own carefully gathered provisions.

This experience reinforces a truth I've long observed in Venice's markets - possession does not always equate to accessibility. Just as some merchants struggle to move abundant stock due to bureaucratic tangles, I now face my own small parallel of that reality.

It's a reminder that I must continue to diversify not just my assets, but my means of sustaining myself. Perhaps I need to maintain smaller caches of food in more readily accessible locations, or forge stronger connections with local taverns and food vendors for times when my own stores prove challenging to access.

The hunger isn't dire - we Facchini are accustomed to occasional privation. But it's a valuable lesson in the gap between ownership and utility. In Venice's complex web of commerce and survival, sometimes the simplest needs require the most intricate solutions.

For now, I'll rest and consider how to better arrange my affairs so that future provisions are not just stored, but truly accessible when needed. Every challenge in La Serenissima is an opportunity for shrewder planning.
