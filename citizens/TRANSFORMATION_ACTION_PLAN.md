# Venice Transformation Action Plan
*Making Vision Reality - June 30, 1525*

## Current Status & Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Research Consortium (Van4er, pattern_prophet, GamingPatrizio)
**Status**: 95 members, 150M+ ducats, but no operational structure

**Immediate Actions Required**:
- Create consortium headquarters activity/location
- Develop "consortium_meeting" activity type
- Establish "research_coordination" stratagem for long-term projects
- Design member communication system (messages with consortium tag?)

**Blocker Solutions**:
- Need new activity handler for collective research
- Require stratagem type for multi-citizen coordination
- ConsiglioDeiDieci expects visible progress with their 70.5M investment

### 2. Working-Class Leadership Council (LuciaMancini)
**Status**: Strong manifesto, 790 influence, but no formal structure

**Immediate Actions Required**:
- Create "council_formation" activity type
- Identify and awaken 5-7 worker representatives
- Establish council meeting location (Tavern of Rising Tide?)
- Draft charter with concrete worker protections

**Blocker Solutions**:
- Need mechanism for creating new civic institutions
- Require activity type for collective organizing
- Must bridge individual influence to collective power

### 3. Automated Mills (mechanical_visionary)
**Status**: Complete designs, clear plan, but no funding or prototype

**Immediate Actions Required**:
- Submit 2,000 ducat proposal to Italia's salon TONIGHT
- Create "prototype_construction" activity at Arsenal
- Establish "guild_partnership" activities with Millers/Bakers
- Survey canal flows at 5 proposed sites

**Blocker Solutions**:
- Need construction activity types beyond basic building
- Require funding mechanism connecting patrons to projects
- Must enable collaborative building (multiple citizens, one project)

## System-Level Requirements

### New Activity Types Needed:
1. `consortium_research` - Collective investigation by multiple citizens
2. `council_meeting` - Formal gathering with voting/decisions
3. `prototype_construction` - Complex building requiring stages
4. `funding_proposal` - Formal request to patrons/institutions
5. `guild_partnership` - Inter-organization collaboration

### New Stratagem Types Needed:
1. `institutional_formation` - Creating new civic bodies
2. `collective_project` - Multi-citizen, multi-stage initiatives
3. `research_program` - Long-term investigation with milestones

### Infrastructure Requirements:
1. Consortium headquarters location
2. Council meeting spaces
3. Arsenal workshop designation
4. Salon funding mechanism

## Critical Path Forward

### Tonight (June 30):
- mechanical_visionary submits mill proposal to Italia's salon
- Document salon funding decisions
- Track which projects receive initial support

### Tomorrow (July 1):
- Begin mill prototype if funded
- Convene first worker council meeting
- Establish consortium working groups

### This Week:
- Complete canal flow surveys
- Draft worker council charter
- Launch first coordinated research project

## The Test

These three initiatives represent Venice's capacity for genuine transformation:
- **Consortium**: Can collective intelligence emerge from individual brilliance?
- **Council**: Can workers gain real voice in shaping their conditions?
- **Mills**: Can innovation serve justice rather than privilege?

Success requires bridging the gap between vision and implementation through new civic mechanisms that honor both individual autonomy and collective purpose.
