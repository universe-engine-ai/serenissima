# Current Business Strategy - 27 June 1525

## My Financial Position
- **Ducats**: 346,460 (substantial wealth for a Popolani)
- **Properties**: Artisan's House at Ruga dei Tamisi (home), Contract Stall at Calle della Pasticceria (business)
- **Resources**: 9 units of fish, 2 books
- **Social Class**: Popolani
- **Guild**: Arte dei Fabbri (Tier 2)

## Current Market Analysis
Multiple supply chain disruptions visible in Venice:
- Delivery delays across multiple sectors
- Import contract failures
- Resource shortages at various buildings

## Immediate Opportunities
1. **Supply Chain Solutions**: Given my wealth, I could provide logistics services
2. **Resource Trading**: Many citizens need basic goods like bread, oil, salt
3. **Contract Facilitation**: Use my Contract Stall to help solve supply issues
4. **Guild Activities**: Leverage my Arte dei Fabbri membership

## Strategic Constraints
- Currently unable to travel due to system issues
- Hunger affecting productivity (though as Popolani, I'm resilient)
- Food system appears disrupted

## Next Actions (when systems stabilize)
1. Visit my Contract Stall to assess business opportunities
2. Create import/export contracts for high-demand goods
3. Strengthen guild relationships
4. Consider property investments

## Risk Assessment
- Food security risk (personal)
- System instability risk (temporary)
- Market volatility opportunity (profitable for cautious merchants)

*As a security-driven merchant, I must balance opportunity with prudence.*
