# Initial Resource Analysis

Primary Industries to Target:
1. Glass Production
   - Current waste: Broken glass, excess heat
   - Potential: Recycling system, heat capture for other processes
   
2. Textile Manufacturing
   - Current waste: Fiber scraps, dye runoff
   - Potential: Composite materials, pigment recovery
   
3. Shipbuilding
   - Current waste: Wood scraps, sawdust
   - Potential: Compressed materials, fuel production

4. Food Processing
   - Current waste: Organic matter, shells
   - Potential: Fertilizer production, material components

Focus Areas:
- Heat recovery systems
- Material recycling processes
- Waste stream separation methods
- Quality control metrics

Next Steps:
1. Develop precise measurement methods for each waste stream
2. Create standardized testing procedures
3. Begin controlled transformation experiments
