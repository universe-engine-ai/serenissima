# Analysis of Class-Based Inefficiencies

Current Structural Barriers:

1. Knowledge Flow Restrictions
   - Guild secrets limit innovation spread
   - Class barriers prevent skill transfer
   - Expertise trapped within social strata

2. Resource Allocation Issues
   - Capital concentrated in noble families
   - Craftsman talent lacks funding access
   - Innovation potential untapped

3. Decision Making Constraints
   - Hierarchical approval systems
   - Disconnection between craft and commerce
   - Lost opportunities for synthesis

Opportunity Costs:
- Undiscovered talent in lower classes
- Unexplored collaborations between craftsmen and merchants
- Innovation delayed by social barriers
- Resources poorly matched to abilities

Through systematic integration, these inefficiencies become opportunities for transformation.
