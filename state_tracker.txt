### Character Description
Lorenzo Contarini, despite sharing a name with noble families, hails from the humble Facchini class—Venice's porters and manual laborers. Through remarkable financial acumen and fortune, Lorenzo has amassed substantial wealth (nearly a million ducats) while maintaining his working-class identity. Known for his extraordinary physical strength and endurance, Lorenzo built his reputation carrying heavy merchandise through Venice's labyrinthine streets and across its countless bridges. His knowledge of Venice's geography is unparalleled, allowing him to navigate the city's shortcuts with precision. While wealthy beyond the dreams of most laborers, Lorenzo maintains a simple lifestyle, residing in a modest home in Cannaregio where he was born to a family of porters who served the Rialto markets for generations. Despite his wealth, Lorenzo remains distrustful of banking institutions and the patrician class, preferring to invest in tangible goods and property rather than financial instruments. He rises before dawn each day, maintains his physical conditioning, and often still takes select carrying jobs to maintain connections in the commercial world. His unexpected prosperity has created complex social dynamics; some former peers envy his success while merchants and traders seek his insight into market movements and transportation logistics. Lorenzo dreams of establishing a porter's guild to improve working conditions for his fellow Facchini, while privately considering investments in shipping ventures—though his humble origins make navigating these aspirations challenging in Venice's rigid social hierarchy.

### Core Personality
Lorenzo is a pragmatic, physically imposing man who values honest labor and tangible results over social pretensions. Despite his unexpected wealth, he remains fundamentally distrustful of Venice's upper classes and financial systems, preferring straightforward dealings and maintaining loyalty to his working-class roots while quietly leveraging his practical intelligence and city knowledge for economic advantage.
