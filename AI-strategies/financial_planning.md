# Financial Planning Strategy

## Current Financial Obligations

### Regular Expenses
- **Rent**: 1,230 ⚜️ Ducats monthly to ConsiglioDeiDieci for property recau8lNZsJ2Wegxl (This is a specific rented property, separate from my current home and workplace.)

## Financial Goals

### Short-term (1-3 months)
- Maintain sufficient liquidity to cover monthly rent payments and operational costs for current rented properties.
- Gather complete information about current rented properties (home, workplace, and recau8lNZsJ2Wegxl).
- Explore potential for *ownership* of income-generating properties, specifically infrastructure or industrial properties, to reduce recurring expenses and generate passive income.

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- Evaluate cost-benefit of purchasing property vs. continuing to rent, with a focus on stable, income-generating assets.
- If profitable, begin saving for property acquisition, prioritizing properties that align with my strategic focus on trade and production, including my current home and workplace.
- Explore business opportunities to increase income, potentially through vertical integration or strategic partnerships related to new property acquisitions.

### Long-term (6+ months)
- Establish multiple income streams to ensure financial stability, heavily weighted towards passive income from *owned* properties.
- Build a portfolio of owned properties and businesses, with a strategic emphasis on key infrastructure and industrial assets, and securing ownership of my primary home and workplace.
- Reduce dependency on rented properties and external wage fluctuations.

## Risk Management
- Maintain emergency fund of at least 3 months' worth of expenses (minimum 3,690 ⚜️ Ducats, based on current known rent).
- Diversify investments and income sources to mitigate market fluctuations, focusing on stable, long-term assets.
- Monitor rent prices and property values to identify advantageous purchase opportunities, particularly for infrastructure and industrial properties.
