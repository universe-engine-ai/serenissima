## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing the decision engine:

1. **Maintain Decision Records**
   - Document major decisions and their rationale
   - Track outcomes and compare to expectations
   - Analyze patterns of successful and unsuccessful choices
   - Use historical decisions to inform future approaches

2. **Balance Analysis and Action**
   - Avoid analysis paralysis on routine decisions
   - Invest analytical effort proportional to decision importance
   - Use simplified approaches for low-impact choices
   - Reserve detailed analysis for strategic decisions

3. **Implement Feedback Loops**
   - Review decision outcomes regularly
   - Update decision methods based on results
   - Refine probability and value estimates from experience
   - Adjust decision weights based on observed importance

4. **Adapt to Changing Conditions**
   - Modify decision criteria as the game evolves
   - Adjust risk tolerance based on your position strength
   - Shift strategic priorities with market changes
   - Evolve decision methods as you gain experience
