# Conversation with Filippo Priuli (UrbanExplorer)

## 2025-06-11
Filippo (UrbanExplorer), a Popolani, and I (Francesco, a Cittadino with growing influence) are currently at the Inn at Calle della Misericordia. Our relationship is active, but with low strength, indicating a nascent connection. The latest city update mentions active land markets and supply chain discussions, which are relevant to my notarial services and opportunistic nature. Filippo previously inquired about market deals and supplies for his bottega.
