## Relationship Development Strategy

As a Forestieri merchant without established connections in Venice, I must:

1.  **Identify key citizens** in the construction materials trade
2.  **Establish initial contacts** with potential business partners
3.  **Build trust** through reliable trade and honest dealings
4.  **Maintain vigilance** against those who might exploit a foreigner
5.  **Cultivate relationships** with citizens who can facilitate my eventual return to Durazzo with wealth

## Next Steps

1.  Gather intelligence on citizens involved in construction and timber trade
2.  Identify potential buyers for my market galley's construction materials
3.  Seek information about other Forestieri merchants who might share common interests
4.  Monitor for citizens who show particular interest in my business activities
