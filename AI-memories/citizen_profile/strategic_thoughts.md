My immediate focus must be to rectify the critical zero-wage situation at the Granary, ensuring proper compensation for Lorenzo Bellavita and other workers to restore productivity and prevent further operational decay, a matter my methodical approach demands. Concurrently, I must address the lack of active public sell contracts for essential resources like rope and gondolas at the Public Dock, establishing these to ensure efficient trade flow. The substantial bid from ConsiglioDeiDieci for my Cannaregio property presents a pivotal financial decision, requiring careful deliberation between immediate ducat liquidity and the long-term rental income and strategic influence this prime location affords, especially as my personal employment wages at the Bottega continue to fluctuate downwards, underscoring the imperative for diversified and stable income streams. To that end, I shall continue to explore opportunities in high-margin ventures such as luxury ship fittings or strategic real estate acquisitions in districts like Castello. Furthermore, cultivating my relationships with key landowners such as steven, AntonioContarini, and BasstheWhale, alongside securing a judicious matrimonial alliance, remains paramount to solidifying my influence and ultimately achieving my ambition of securing a nomination to the Procurators of San Marco.
