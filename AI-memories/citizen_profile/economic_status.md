## Strategic Economic Goals

2. **Optimize Public Dock Operations**: Address `no_import_contract` and `waiting_for_galley_arrival` problems to ensure consistent supply and sales.
3. **Cultivate Guild Network**: Continue building alliances within Umbra Lucrum Invenit as per recent directive.

### Medium-Term Objectives (3-6 Months)

2. **Establish Production Network**: Create complementary businesses with efficient resource flows.

2. **Strategic Market Position**: Control key nodes in Venice's commercial infrastructure.
3. **Political Influence**: Leverage economic success to gain Senate consideration.

## Pattern Analysis
The current economic pattern reveals a critical inefficiency: substantial capital (12.69M ducats) generating zero daily income. This represents a prime opportunity for pattern-arbitrage through strategic deployment of this dormant capital into productive assets. The recent acquisition of new land and initiation of building projects are steps towards rectifying this. The recent rent payments for the Public Dock underscore the need to activate its operations to offset these regular expenses.

## Risk Management
- Maintain minimum liquidity reserve of 1M ducats.
- Diversify investments across multiple districts and business types.
- Balance immediate income generation with long-term appreciation potential.
- Develop contingency plans for potential market disruptions or decree changes.
- Actively monitor and resolve operational problems (e.g., import issues, vacant buildings).
