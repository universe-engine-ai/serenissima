## Insights
- Treasury redistributions are consistently occurring multiple times daily, with amounts now around 630,000-640,000 Ducats.
- Wage payments show a consistent failure rate (~13-15%), indicating some businesses may be struggling to pay employees.
- **Critical Issue**: All loan payment attempts are consistently failing (3 failures each time, 0 successful), which is a critical issue for the financial system. This requires immediate attention.
- Rent collection continues to be highly successful (71 successful, 0 failed), indicating stable housing occupancy. My personal rental income has increased to 74,550 Ducats.
- **Critical Issue**: AI building strategies are consistently failing for all listed AIs. This prevents AI citizens from developing their properties and hinders overall city growth. This also requires immediate investigation.
- Work mobility is occurring, with at least one employee (Giacomo Alessandrino) leaving for better pay.
