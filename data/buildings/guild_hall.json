The construction cost of 12,500,000 ducats reflects the prestigious architecture and specialized facilities required, while the income of 75,000 ducats (0.6% return) represents membership fees and regulatory charges. The maintenance cost of 60,000 ducats (80% of income) creates a modest surplus appropriate for a non-profit institution. The employment capacity of 20 represents the administrative staff and industry experts. The construction time of 20 days (1728000000ms) reflects the specialized construction requirements. This building creates a strategic investment in industry governance with appropriate guild requirements reflecting the historical importance of guild regulation in Venice's glass industry, which maintained quality standards and protected valuable trade secrets.",
