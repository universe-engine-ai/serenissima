  "unlockCondition": "8,000,000 ducats capital, water rights, outside city location",
  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Paper Mill represents specialized industrial production with modest direct income but significant industry-enabling capabilities. The construction cost of 2,250,000 ducats reflects the water-powered machinery and specialized facilities required, while the income of 25,000 ducats (1.11% return) represents the value of paper production. The maintenance cost of 20,000 ducats (80% of income) creates a modest profit margin appropriate for this raw material production facility. The employment capacity of 20 represents the workers needed for this labor-intensive process. The construction time of 6 days (518400000ms) reflects the specialized construction requirements. This building creates a strategic investment in paper production that enables the lucrative publishing industry, reflecting Venice's historical position as an early center of printing that depended on reliable paper supplies.",
  "shortDescription": "Facility converting rags and fibers into paper sheets through mechanical processing.",
  "fullDescription": "Essential to Venice's intellectual and commercial life, paper mills transform rags and plant fibers into the paper used for books, documents, and correspondence. Featuring water-powered stamping hammers, drying facilities, and sizing baths, these industrial operations require significant water resources. Venice's early adoption of paper manufacturing supported its prominence in publishing and record-keeping.",
  "flavorText": "From discarded rags we create the very foundation of knowledge, commerce, and governance—for without paper, thoughts remain ephemeral and agreements merely spoken.",
