  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Merchant's House represents middle-class housing with business capabilities. The construction cost of 1,600,000 ducats reflects the quality construction and business facilities, while the income of 30,000 ducats (1.9% return) represents both residential rent and commercial activities. The maintenance cost of 7,500 ducats (25% of income) creates an appropriate maintenance ratio for this tier, reflecting the more complex structure and higher standards. The residentsCapacity of 7 represents the merchant family with servants. The construction time of 4 days (345600000ms) reflects the more sophisticated construction. This building creates a progression into middle-class housing with appropriate guild requirements reflecting the social organization of Renaissance Venice, where guild membership was essential for commercial activities.",
  "shortDescription": "Comfortable residence with dedicated office space for business dealings.",
  "fullDescription": "A respectable home for Venice's merchant class, featuring separate areas for business and family life. Typically includes a ground floor counting room or office, a piano nobile (noble floor) for family living, and often additional floors for storage or servants. Represents success in Venice's trading world.",
  "flavorText": "Ledgers below, living above—the merchant's house is a perfect balance of commerce and comfort, just as the merchant balances risk and reward.",
