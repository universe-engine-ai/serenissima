  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Fondaco dei Tedeschi represents a major commercial investment with significant returns. The construction cost of 7,500,000 ducats reflects the massive scale and institutional nature of this trading complex, while the income of 75,000 ducats (1% return) represents the substantial commercial activity it facilitates. The maintenance cost of 35,000 ducats (47% of income) balances profitability with the reality of maintaining a large commercial complex. The employment capacity of 40 reflects the administrative staff, guards, and workers needed to operate this international trading center. The construction time of 15 days (1296000000ms) represents a major project appropriate for advanced players. This building creates a strategic investment in international trade with appropriate requirements reflecting the political and diplomatic nature of establishing foreign trading posts in Renaissance Venice.",

  "fullDescription": "A cornerstone of Venice's international trade, this massive complex serves as headquarters for German merchants. Combining warehouse facilities, living quarters, offices, and trading halls, the fondaco creates a self-contained community for foreign traders under Venetian oversight. State regulations require all German goods to pass through this building, making it a vital link to Northern European contracts while allowing careful tax collection.",
