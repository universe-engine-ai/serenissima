    "historicalSignificance": "The gondola evolved over centuries to become perfectly adapted to Venice's unique environment. Its asymmetrical design allows a single gondolier to propel and steer it through narrow canals. Originally colorful, a 16th-century decree mandated the now-iconic black color. Gondolas served as the primary transportation method for Venetians of all classes before becoming more associated with wealthy citizens and tourists in later centuries.",
