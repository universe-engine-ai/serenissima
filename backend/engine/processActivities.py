Process Concluded Activities script for La Serenissima.

This script:
1. Fetches all activities that are concluded (EndDate is in the past) and not yet processed.
2. For "deliver_resource_batch" activities:
   - Transfers resources from the delivery citizen (owned by the merchant) to the target building.
   - Checks storage capacity of the target building.
   - Updates or creates resource records in the target building for its operator/owner.
   - Processes financial transactions based on the original contracts in the batch.
3. For "goto_home" activities:
   - Identifies all resources owned by the citizen (AssetType='citizen', Owner=CitizenUsername, Asset=CitizenCustomId).
   - Checks storage capacity of the citizen's home.
   - Transfers these resources from the citizen's personal inventory to their home building.
   - The resources in the home building remain owned by the citizen.
4. For "goto_work" activities:
   - Identifies resources carried by the citizen (`AssetType`='citizen', `Asset`=CitizenCustomId) that are owned by the operator (`RunBy`) of the workplace.
   - Checks storage capacity of the workplace.
   - If space allows, transfers these resources from the citizen's personal inventory to the workplace building.
   - The resources in the workplace building become owned by the workplace operator.
5. For "production" activities:
   - Retrieves the `RecipeInputs` and `RecipeOutputs` from the activity.
   - Verifies if the production building (identified by `FromBuilding`) has sufficient input resources owned by the building operator.
   - Verifies if the building has enough storage capacity for the output resources after inputs are consumed.
   - If both checks pass:
     - Consumes (decrements/deletes) the input resources from the building's inventory.
     - Produces (increments/creates) the output resources in the building's inventory, owned by the operator.
6. For "fetch_resource" activities (upon arrival at `FromBuilding` - the source):
   - Determines the actual amount of resource to pick up based on:
     - Amount specified in the contract/activity.
     - Stock available at `FromBuilding` (owned by the building's operator/seller).
     - Citizen's remaining carrying capacity (max 10 units total).
     - Buyer's (from contract) available Ducats to pay for the resources.
   - If a positive amount can be fetched:
     - Processes financial transaction: Buyer pays Seller.
     - Decrements resource stock from `FromBuilding`.
     - Adds resource to the citizen's personal inventory. The resource on the citizen is marked as owned by the `Buyer` from the contract.
   - Updates the citizen's `Position` to be at the `FromBuilding`.
7. Updates the activity status to "processed" or "failed". If processed successfully:
   - For most activities with a `ToBuilding` destination, the citizen's `Position` (coordinates) and `UpdatedAt` fields are updated to reflect their new location.
   - For `fetch_resource` activities, the processor itself handles updating the citizen's position to the `FromBuilding` (pickup location), so the generic update is skipped.

IMPORTANT: Activity processors should ONLY process the current activity and NOT create follow-up activities.
Follow-up activities should be created by activity creators in the activity_creators directory.
Processors should focus on:
1. Executing the effects of the current activity (e.g., transferring resources, updating citizen state)
2. Returning success/failure status
3. NOT creating new activities (this is the responsibility of activity creators)
