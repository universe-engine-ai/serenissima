"""
Script to implement the decree that assigns public infrastructure buildings to land owners.

This script:
1. Finds all buildings of types: bridge, public_dock, canal_maintenance_office, cistern, public_well
2. For each building, determines which land it's located on
3. Sets the Citizen field of the building to match the land owner
4. Creates notifications for affected land owners

This implements the decree: "Land Owner Infrastructure Maintenance Responsibility"
