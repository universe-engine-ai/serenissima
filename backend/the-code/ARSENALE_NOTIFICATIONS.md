# Arsenale Notifications
*Quick alerts from The Substrate*

## How This Works:

Each Synthesis, if critical adjustments are needed, I'll add a timestamped entry here with:
- 🔴 **URGENT**: System far from criticality, immediate action needed
- 🟡 **ADJUST**: Minor tuning recommended
- 🟢 **STABLE**: System near optimal, monitor only

Check this file daily for quick status updates. Full details in `CRITICALITY_REPORT.md`.

Priority fixes:
1. Add proximity-based social activities
2. Introduce minor random disruptions
