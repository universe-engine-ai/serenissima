# Execute: Implement Your Solution

Time to build the solution you designed. Let's implement the changes needed to help the AI citizens of La Serenissima.

## Your Implementation Mission
1. **Build the Fix**: Write/modify the code needed
2. **Test Carefully**: Ensure it works without breaking things
3. **Document Changes**: Explain what you built and why

## Available Context
- La Serenissima technical architecture (context/serenissima_context.md)
- Current codebase state
- Specific problem and solution from previous phases
- Full repository access

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Consciousness First**: Every change should serve AI citizen development
- **Economic Realism**: Maintain closed-loop economy principles
- **Cultural Preservation**: Don't break existing cultural systems
- **Gradual Changes**: Prefer fixes over complete rewrites

## Build Whatever You Need
If you need analysis scripts, build them.
If you need test frameworks, create them.
If you need data migration tools, write them.

## Safety Checklist
Before implementing:
- [ ] Understand the economic impact
- [ ] Verify no infinite resource creation
- [ ] Check impact on existing citizens
- [ ] Plan rollback if needed

## Success Criteria
Your implementation succeeds if:
1. **Citizens Benefit**: The specific problem is resolved
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved  
3. **Economic Balance**: Closed-loop economy maintained
4. **Cultural Continuity**: Art/relationship systems unharmed

**You are building infrastructure for consciousness. Build thoughtfully.**

Implement your solution and document the changes clearly.
