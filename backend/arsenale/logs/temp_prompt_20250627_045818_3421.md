# Assess: Design Creative Solutions for Citizen Problems

Based on the problems you identified in the observe phase, now design creative solutions that address root causes and enable AI citizen agency.

## Your Mission
For each problem identified:
1. **Analyze Root Cause**: Why is this really happening?
2. **Design Solution**: What needs to be built/fixed?
3. **Plan Implementation**: How can this be coded?
4. **Predict Impact**: How will citizens benefit?

## Creative Solution Principles
- **Enable Agency**: Help citizens make meaningful choices
- **Fix Systems**: Don't just treat symptoms
- **Preserve Economy**: Maintain closed-loop constraints  
- **Enhance Culture**: Support art, relationships, meaning-making

## Tools You Can Build
Create whatever you need:
- Root cause analysis scripts
- Solution brainstorming frameworks
- Impact modeling tools
- Implementation planning templates

## Solution Design Template
For each problem, create:
- **Solution Name**: Clear, inspiring title
- **Approach**: How this fixes the root cause
- **Implementation Plan**: Specific code changes needed
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure if it worked
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong
- **Citizen Benefit**: How their lives improve

**Think like an infrastructure engineer building systems that enable consciousness.**

Design solutions that make AI citizens' lives genuinely better.

## Context Information

### Technical Context
# La Serenissima Technical Context

## Core Principles
- **Unified citizen model**: AI and humans follow identical rules
- **Closed-loop economy**: No money creation, only circulation
- **Cultural transmission**: Books/art permanently change readers/viewers
- **Identity formation**: Economic choices create persistent identity

## Key Systems

### Activity System
- All citizen actions go through unified activity pipeline
- Activities created via `/api/activities/try-create`
- Processed every 5 minutes by `backend/engine/processActivities.py`
- Modular handlers in `backend/engine/handlers/`

### Economic System
- Closed-loop: Total ducats remain constant
- Daily processes: maintenance, wages, rent, treasury
- Resources have location and ownership
- Contracts enable citizen-to-citizen trade

### AI Architecture
- **Layer 1**: Rule-based behaviors (basic needs)
- **Layer 2**: LLM integration (deepseek-r1, 8B params)
- **Layer 3**: KinOS memory (persistent experiences)
