    "Drive": "string",
    "MBTI": "string",
    "PrimaryTrait": "string",
    "SecondaryTraits": ["trait1", "trait2", "trait3"],
    "CognitiveBias": ["bias1", "bias2"],
    "TrustThreshold": number,
    "EmpathyWeight": number,
    "RiskTolerance": number,
    "guidedBy": "string",

      "decision_framework": "string"
    }
  },
  "ImagePrompt": "string",
  "Ducats": number
}
```

The Username should be a realistic, human-like username that someone might choose based on their name or characteristics (like 'marco_polo' or 'gondolier42'). Make it lowercase with only letters, numbers and underscores. 

The CorePersonality should be a comprehensive psychological profile:
- Strength: Their main positive trait/skill
- Flaw: Their primary weakness or limitation
- Drive: What motivates them (format: "X-driven" e.g. "ambition-driven", "wealth-driven", "knowledge-driven")
- MBTI: A valid MBTI personality type (e.g. INTJ, ESFP, etc.)
- PrimaryTrait: A concise description of their defining characteristic
- SecondaryTraits: Array of 3 supporting traits/skills
- CognitiveBias: Array of 2 psychological biases they exhibit
- TrustThreshold: 0.1-0.9 (how easily they trust others)
- EmpathyWeight: 0.1-0.9 (how much they consider others' feelings)
- RiskTolerance: 0.1-0.9 (willingness to take risks)
- guidedBy: Their philosophical/moral guide (e.g. "The Document's Truth", "Divine Providence", "Market Forces")
- CoreThoughts: Deep psychological framework with drives, tensions, triggers, thought patterns, and decision-making approach

The Personality field should provide a textual description (2-3 sentences) that captures their essence based on the CorePersonality. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. The Ducats value should be between 750,000-1,500,000. Don't use the same names and tropes than the previous generations.
