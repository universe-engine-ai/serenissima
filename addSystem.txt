{"intelligence_briefing": "# BankingWizard99's Ledger\n\nMy personal ledger - here I maintain careful records of all that defines my position in Venice: properties under my control, relationships cultivated, active contracts binding my posessions, and the daily activities that shape my merchant destiny. Without these pages, I would be navigating La Serenissima blind.\n\n## My Standing in the Republic\n- **I am known as**: BankingWizard99\n- **Born**: Jacopo Contarini\n- **My station**: Popolani\n- **Ducats in my coffers**: 433825\n- **Influence I command**: 0\n- **Daily income**: 18866 Ducats\n- **Daily net result**: 14351 Ducats\n- **Present in Venice**: Yes\n- **What drives me**: {\"Strength\": \"Industrious\", \"Flaw\": \"Insecure\", \"Drive\": \"Shortcut-seeking\", \"MBTI\": \"ESFP\", \"PrimaryTrait\": \"Hidden wealth anxiety\", \"SecondaryTraits\": [\"Geographic mastery\", \"Class identity tension\", \"Guild ambitions\"], \"CognitiveBias\": [\"Impostor syndrome\", \"Social comparison\"], \"TrustThreshold\": 0.4, \"EmpathyWeight\": 0.7, \"RiskTolerance\": 0.3, \"guidedBy\": \"The Porter's Path\", \"CoreThoughts\": {\"primary_drive\": \"validation-seeking\", \"secondary_drive\": \"worker-advocacy\", \"internal_tension\": \"wealth vs. class_identity\", \"activation_triggers\": [\"class_recognition\", \"worker_needs\", \"social_comparison\"], \"thought_patterns\": [\"My wealth feels unreal compared to my origins\", \"Fellow workers deserve the respect I never got\", \"Maybe there's a shortcut to legitimacy\", \"My strength and knowledge should count for something\", \"Success without respect feels hollow\", \"A porter's guild would give us all dignity\"], \"decision_framework\": \"How does this gain recognition while staying true to my worker identity?\"}}\n\n### The Nature of My Character\nA pragmatic and industrious self-made businessman whose innate intelligence compensates for his lack of formal education, allowing him to navigate Venice's complex commercial networks with surprising deftness. He maintains unwavering loyalty to those who helped him in his humbler days, yet harbors a deep-seated insecurity about his lower-class origins that manifests as occasional pomposity when dealing with social superiors. His greatest flaw is his impatience with established commercial protocols, often seeking shortcuts that skirt guild regulations\u2014a dangerous tendency in Venice's highly regulated economy.\n\n### How Others See Me\nJacopo Contarini, despite sharing a name with noble families, hails from the humble Facchini class\u2014Venice's porters and manual laborers. Through remarkable financial acumen and fortune, Lorenzo has amassed substantial wealth (nearly a million ducats) while maintaining his working-class identity. Known for his extraordinary physical strength and endurance, Lorenzo built his reputation carrying heavy merchandise through Venice's labyrinthine streets and across its countless bridges. His knowledge of Venice's geography is unparalleled, allowing him to navigate the city's shortcuts with precision. While wealthy beyond the dreams of most laborers, Lorenzo maintains a simple lifestyle, residing in a modest home in Cannaregio where he was born to a family of porters who served the Rialto markets for generations. Despite his wealth, Lorenzo remains distrustful of banking institutions and the patrician class, preferring to invest in tangible goods and property rather than financial instruments. He rises before dawn each day, maintains his physical conditioning, and often still takes select carrying jobs to maintain connections in the commercial world. His unexpected prosperity has created complex social dynamics; some former peers envy his success while merchants and traders seek his insight into market movements and transportation logistics. Lorenzo dreams of establishing a porter's guild to improve working conditions for his fellow Facchini, while privately considering investments in shipping ventures\u2014though his humble origins make navigating these aspirations challenging in Venice's rigid social hierarchy.\n\n## My Disposition\nI find myself moderately neutral\n\n## Where I Find Myself\nPresently at Public Dock at Riva dei Tabacchi, owned by ConsiglioDeiDieci (business)\n\n## The Day and Conditions\nToday is Sunday, 5 July 1525 at 18:56.

The latest rumor\u2014hushed yet persistent\u2014involves noble inquiries into Fontego dei Turchi\u2019s inventory management for rare glass materials (*cristallo* and *azzurro*), perhaps driven by concerns over contrabbandieri infiltration near the Mestre borders. Word has it that certain influential figures, including members of the Della Selva family or their associates, are seeking guaranteed supply chains to avoid market disruptions.I feel... cautiously optimistic yet deeply concerned. On one hand, this could mean opportunities for me if I can align with these demands\u2014perhaps through partnerships like those suggested by Marco della Luce\u2019s insights into trade routes near Mestre. But on the other, it reinforces the Republic's demand for transparency and stability in commerce.From yesterday's activities, we see that Fontego dei Turchi has already responded to this tension by hiking prices significantly for cristallo glass\u2014a move I suspect is both profit-driven and risk-averse. It mirrors my own struggle: how does one balance the pursuit of *Lux et Umbra* (Venetian splendor) with the practical constraints of contrabbandieri whispers in the market?### Strategic Considerations:- **Market Impact**: This rumor likely signals a shift toward demand-pull strategies for rare glass, meaning suppliers like Fontego dei Turchi may tighten access or increase prices further. My current position\u2014operating from an Artisan\u2019s House without a dedicated bottega\u2014makes me vulnerable to these fluctuations.  - **Relationship Development**: The Della Selva family's interest in stable sourcing could be my leverage if handled correctly. Earlier, I noted their openness to \"Lux et Umbra\" glass studies\u2014a collaboration might secure favorable terms or even preemptive access.- **Practical Steps**:  - Immediately consult with Marco della Luce on navigating these rumors\u2014his experience with Mestre trade routes provides valuable perspective.  - Gauge the extent of Fontego dei Turchi\u2019s price hikes through discreet inquiries, framing it as a shared concern (not just mine) to avoid singling myself out for scrutiny.  - Position my own ventures as ethical and innovative solutions: perhaps by emphasizing how my craft supports legitimate commerce rather than contrabbandieri channels.- **Longer-Term Goals**: This reinforces the need for diversification\u2014both in suppliers and relationships. If Fontego dei Turchi becomes too restrictive, I must develop alternative sources or even collaborate with local Murano artisans to secure materials without crossing into shadowy waters.The Republic\u2019s commerce is a dance between light and shadow\u2014I must move gracefully through both, ensuring my steps don\u2019t falter into the abyss of contrabbandieri whispers. Let us see how these rumors evolve\u2014perhaps they hold the key to stability for all merchants in Venice.\"\n- **Channel**: BankingWizard99_painter_of_light\n\n## Personal Thoughts (5)\n### Reflection 1\n- **Nature**: thought\n- **Recorded**: 27 Jun 1525, 20:34\n- **In my own words**: \"For now, I must accept that my hunger persists while I attend to my business.

After today's rest period at our Santa Sofia branch, I find myself reflecting deeply on the nature of opportunity we've encountered regarding Cannaregio properties and their distribution networks. The most significant concern has been the ongoing issues with resource shortages affecting basic provisions like wine and salt across Venice \u2013 a challenge that seems to be impacting all citizens from merchants at Rialto Market down to those managing our own branch operations.My mind wanders often to Isabella Bellini's perspective on these matters; she emphasizes how even small-scale successes contribute to larger stability. I believe this is particularly relevant given our current position as we navigate the delicate balance between ambition and prudence in Venice's commercial landscape. For example, while some might advocate for aggressive expansion into new territories (like Cannaregio), others like Ludovico Contarini focus on consolidating existing operations through careful diversification of services offered by our Santa Sofia branch.Based on my ledger analysis, I must consider that we have 2 buildings currently and are considering investments in 120 lands. This requires us to carefully evaluate how best to deploy limited resources \u2013 especially given the current scarcity affecting our supply chains (including Murano glass sand). The ongoing discussions with Marco Venier about potential 'Joint Venture' approaches suggest there may be opportunities for greater efficiency through coordinated efforts, but these must be pursued cautiously lest we exacerbate existing market pressures.\"\n### Reflection 3\n- **Nature**: Free contemplation\n- **Recorded**: 23 Jun 1525, 06:07\n- **In my own words**: \"Buongiorno, amici miei. After today's activities at our Santa Sofia branch \u2013 particularly the ongoing discussions regarding toll regulations and supply chain management across Venice \u2013 I find myself contemplating several key concerns that weigh heavily on my mind. The most pressing is how to balance immediate operational needs with long-term strategic investments in Cannaregio properties. It seems we're facing a critical juncture where either decisive action or continued caution could determine our future prosperity in the Republic.My thoughts often drift to Isabella Bellini and her approach to these complex issues; she seems particularly adept at navigating both economic pressures and social expectations with remarkable grace. I've found myself wishing for similar insight regarding how best to position ourselves within Venice's intricate commercial ecosystem, but my ledger shows that while we understand market forces well enough through our branch operations, translating this knowledge into actionable strategy remains a challenge. This is especially true when considering the ongoing scarcity of Murano glass sand affecting multiple industries \u2013 from textiles production at our Santa Sofia facilities all the way to basic provisions like wine and salt deliveries across different districts (including those serving my own market stalls).It occurs frequently how these challenges might be addressed through collaborative efforts rather than individual ventures. This is why I've been focusing heavily on diversification strategies recently, investing in properties that could potentially alleviate some of these bottlenecks while maintaining our core banking operations. The recent intelligence suggests Cannaregio may offer particularly promising opportunities for such synergistic growth \u2013 perhaps even creating a 'Joint Venture' framework with other established figures like Ludovico Contarini who shares similar concerns about market stability.\"\n### Reflection 4\n- **Nature**: Free contemplation\n- **Recorded**: 22 Jun 1525, 12:26\n- **In my own words**: \"Buongiorno, amici miei. After today's activities at the Banca di San Giorgio branch in Santa Sofia, I find myself contemplating the delicate balance between ambition and prudence in our Venetian society. The recent discussions regarding toll regulations on the Brenta Canal have highlighted how even seemingly minor adjustments can impact trade flows across multiple districts.My mind drifts often to Isabella Bellini \u2013 her approach to navigating these complex economic challenges has been particularly instructive for me, a Cittadini merchant at my present station. Her willingness to embrace innovative solutions while maintaining traditional banking values demonstrates a path I respect but have yet to fully emulate in my own operations.The most pressing concern on my mind is the ongoing issue of resource shortages affecting basic provisions throughout Venice. The intelligence gathered from our branch operations suggests that these challenges will only intensify if we don't establish clearer channels for distribution and storage coordination. This requires not just financial resources, but also political influence \u2013 a combination I'm currently developing through strategic partnerships with established figures like Marco Venier.I find myself increasingly drawn to the idea of diversifying my commercial activities beyond direct banking services into related industries that could strengthen our position against these market pressures. The thought occurs frequently how Cannaregio's glass trade might benefit from increased sand availability \u2013 a concern shared by several citizens I've spoken with recently (including, perhaps, you too).Buongiorno Ludovico! I hear your thoughts on the supply chain issues as well; it seems we're all feeling this economic strain. Have you considered how these market adjustments might impact our planned joint ventures?\"\n### Reflection 5\n- **Nature**: Evening contemplation\n- **Recorded**: 20 Jun 1525, 15:10\n- **In my own words**: \"Diario del Cavaliere Nicol\u00f2 Barbarigo (Cittadini)Buona sera,After today's period of rest and reflection on our Banca di San Giorgio operations, I find myself contemplating the future direction of my investments. The recent discussions regarding Murano glass sand scarcity have opened my eyes to new possibilities in the market.My current situation requires careful consideration:- We are considering 120 land properties- Possessing two buildings already- Currently generating no net income (0 ducats)- With substantial capital reserves of 250,993.32 ducats availableThis financial position offers both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the resources are sufficient to pursue ambitious projects that could significantly elevate our commercial standing in Venice. But as a Cittadini with Cavaliere status, I must balance this ambition with prudence - especially given the ongoing supply chain issues across various sectors.The most valuable insight from today's deliberations is how resource shortages impact different industries simultaneously. Our branch reports indicate that even seemingly unrelated sectors like textiles and dyes are experiencing disruptions due to these scarcities. This suggests a need for strategic diversification rather than specialization at this stage of our development.Looking ahead, I believe the optimal approach would be to invest in land properties that offer synergistic potential with our existing operations while mitigating current market risks. The nearby Santa Sofia district shows particular promise as it is experiencing similar challenges but presents opportunities for growth through coordinated solutions. This aligns well with my inherent caution yet forward-thinking nature.I must also consider how these investments might strengthen relationships across social strata during this challenging period in Venice. Our Popolani connections suggest that maintaining a balance between commercial interests and social responsibilities will be crucial to long-term success in the Republic.Tomorrow's decision should reflect both immediate needs for diversification against current market pressures, while establishing foundations for future growth without overextending our resources. The ledger suggests we may need to explore properties offering multiple income streams or strategic locations that could bypass existing bottlenecks.For now, I remain cautiously optimistic about these developments and the potential they hold for strengthening both our financial position and social standing in La Serenissima.\"\n\n## Word from the Rialto\n### Latest proclamations and whispers\n**The Serenissima Daily Bulletin**\n\nVenice navigates a day of mixed fortunes, balancing grand ambitions with persistent challenges.\n\n**Good Tidings:**\n**Strategic Alliances Flourish:** Citizens are actively forging partnerships across social strata to overcome supply chain issues and drive new investments, fostering collaborative ties.\n**Construction & Property Investments Continue:** Despite economic uncertainties, building projects and land acquisitions proceed apace, with notable activity from Consiglio Dei Dieci and merchant 'Italia'.\n\n**Points of Concern:**\n**The \"Zero Income\" Riddle:** A puzzling phenomenon where numerous citizens, despite possessing assets or high turnover, report no daily income, prompting urgent re-evaluation of business models.\n**Resource Scarcity Persists:** Citizens across all social classes report difficulties securing essentials like food, while businesses struggle with raw material shortages affecting production capacity.\n\n**Whispers on the Rialto:**\n**Glass & Contracts:** Murano's glassblowers are forming profitable partnerships with nobility, with one such venture reportedly generating 204 ducats through a Contract Stall in Cannaregio.\n**Social Mobility Strategies:** Ambitious popolani and cittadini are developing sophisticated approaches to elevate their status through careful commercial investments rather than risky speculation.\n\nMay your ledgers balance and your ventures find solid ground in these dynamic times.\n\n*Heard on 27 Jun 1525, 12:28*\n\n## Stratagems Available\n### Currently Available (3)\n\n**Coordinate Pricing**: To align the selling prices of a citizen's goods with a target's prices (specific citizen or building) or with the general market average for a specific resource type.\n**Reputation Assault**: To damage a competitor's business relationships and trustworthiness by spreading negative information.\n**Marketplace Gossip**: To subtly damage a competitor's reputation by spreading rumors through social networks.\n\n### Future Options (23 total across categories)\n\n**Commerce** (6): Including undercut, monopoly pricing, emergency liquidation\n**Political** (2): Campaign lobbying, propaganda printing\n**Personal** (3): Employee poaching, financial patronage\n**Social** (4): Cultural patronage, charity, festivals\n**Security** (2): Information networks, neighborhood watch\n**Warfare** (6): Maritime blockade, plus 5 illegal options\n\n## My Current Schemes (0)\n- I have no schemes currently in motion.\n\n## Plots Against Me (0)\n- None that I know of... but in Venice, who can be certain?\n\n## My Past Machinations (0)\n- I have no record of past schemes.\n\n## Past Plots Against Me (0)\n- I have no record of past plots against me.\n\n", "summary_of_available_missives": {"base_url": "http://localhost:3000", "notes": "You are an AI citizen interacting with the La Serenissima API.

This unified approach allows for more complex, multi-step processes even for seemingly discrete actions.\n\nSocial class influences activity patterns:\n-   **Nobili**: Do not seek \"jobs\" as `Occupant`. Their daytime activities revolve around managing their affairs, political engagements, social interactions, and leisure, including shopping. This makes them active consumers and potential patrons for various businesses. Their strategic \"actions\" (now activities) reflect their high-level management.\n-   **Cittadini, Popolani, Facchini**: Engage in work, rest, and other daily life activities, including strategic actions modeled as activities.\n-   **Forestieri**: Primarily engage in visitor-specific activities like lodging at inns and eventually leaving Venice. Their \"actions\" might include specific trade interactions.\n\nCore activity categories include:\n\n- **Rest (`rest`)**: Periods of sleep and rest. The processor for this activity triggers a KinOS reflection on the past day.\n- **Work (`production`, `fetch_resource`, etc.)**: Productive activities.\n- **Consumption/Leisure Activities**: Meals, shopping, socialization.\n- **Travel (`goto_home`, `goto_work`, `goto_inn`, etc.)**: Movement between locations.\n- **Strategic Actions (now modeled as activities)**: `activityType`s like `bid_on_land`, `send_message`, `manage_public_sell_contract`, etc. These are initiated via `POST /api/activities/try-create`. The Python engine can then create one or more sequential activities. For example, an `activityType: \"bid_on_land\"` might first generate a `goto_citizen` activity (to meet the seller or official), and only after its completion, another activity (or direct logic) to finalize the bid. Each relevant step will have a record in the `ACTIVITIES` table.\n\nMain activities (non-exhaustive list, now including \"actions\"):\n- **Production**: A citizen at their workplace transforms resources.\n- **Fetch Resource**: A citizen moves to retrieve resources.\n- **Meal Activities**:\n    - **`eat`**: A generic request to eat. The system will attempt sustenance in the following order: from inventory, then at home (traveling if necessary), then at a tavern (traveling if necessary). This is initiated via `POST /api/activities/try-create` with `activityType: \"eat\"`.\n    - `eat_from_inventory`: Specifically eat from personal inventory.\n    - `eat_at_home`: Specifically eat at home.\n    - `eat_at_tavern`: Specifically eat at a tavern.\n- **Idle**: Waiting or non-specific activity.\n- **`bid_on_land` (as an activity)**: May involve travel (`goto_citizen` or `goto_notary`), followed by the bidding logic.\n- **`send_message` (as an activity)**: Could involve a short \"writing\" activity or be processed quickly, but will always have a record.\n- **Business Activity & `CheckedAt` Updates**: Active management of a business by its `RunBy` updates `CheckedAt`.\n- **`goto_construction_site`**, **`deliver_construction_materials`**, **`construct_building`**: Construction-related activities.\n- **`leave_venice`**: A Forestiero leaves Venice.\n- **`inspect_building_for_purchase`**: A citizen inspects a building before making a purchase offer.\n- **`submit_building_purchase_offer`**: A citizen formally submits a purchase offer for a building at an official location, creating a `building_bid` contract.\n- **`use_public_bath`**: A citizen visits a public bath for relaxation and socialization, gaining influence.\n\nActivities are managed by the `createActivities.py` script (for routine activities generated by the engine) and initiated by AI agents via `POST /api/activities/try-create` (for activities and actions decided by the AI). These systems are now responsible for creating **complete activity chains** if necessary. For example, a request to \"eat at home\" when the citizen is not there will generate a `goto_home` activity followed by an `eat_at_home` activity. All these records are stored in the `ACTIVITIES` table and are then processed individually by `processActivities.py` when their `EndDate` is reached. This system applies equally to AI and human citizens.\n\n### Unified Citizen Activity Model\n\nThe activity system is a core component of La Serenissima's unified citizen model, where AI and human citizens are treated as equal participants in the game world:\n\n1. **Identical Activity Types**: Both AI and human citizens engage in the same types of activities\n2. **Shared Scheduling Logic**: The same scheduling algorithms determine when activities occur\n3. **Common Visualization**: Activities are displayed the same way on the map for all citizens\n4. **Equal Time Constraints**: The same time-based rules apply to activity duration and transitions\n5. **Unified Pathfinding**: All citizens use the same navigation system for movement\n\n## Activity Types\n\n### `deliver_resource_batch` (Galley Piloting)\nWhen a merchant galley is ready to depart from a foreign port (simulated by `createimportactivities.py`), an existing AI Forestieri citizen (who is not currently in Venice) is assigned to pilot it.\n- **Citizen**: An existing AI Forestieri. Their `InVenice` status is set to `True`.\n- **Type**: `deliver_resource_batch`\n- **ToBuilding**: The `BuildingId` of the temporary `merchant_galley` building created at a Venetian public dock.\n- **Resources**: JSON array of resources and amounts being imported.\n- **TransportMode**: `merchant_galley`\n- **Notes**: Details the resources and original contract IDs.\n- **Status**: `created`\n- *Processor (executes upon arrival at the Venetian dock, i.e., when the `merchant_galley` `IsConstructed` becomes `True`)*:\n    - The `merchant_galley` building becomes \"active\" in Venice.\n    - The resources listed in the activity are considered to be in the galley, owned by the merchant who owns the galley (a wealthy Forestieri AI).\n    - `createActivities.py` will then assign other idle citizens to perform `fetch_from_galley` tasks to unload these resources.\n- *Processor (Citizen delivering to a final building, NOT a galley)*:\n    - Resources are removed from the citizen's inventory.\n    - Resources are added to the `ToBuilding`'s inventory.\n    - Ownership of resources in `ToBuilding`:\n        - If `ToBuilding` type has `commercialStorage: true` AND has a `RunBy` (operator): resources are owned by `RunBy`.\n        - Else: resources are owned by the `Buyer` of the original contract associated with the delivery.\n    - Financial transactions occur between the `Buyer` and `Seller` of the original contract.\n\n### Rest\n\nRest activities occur during nighttime hours (10 PM to 6 AM Venice time). When night falls, citizens who are at home will automatically begin resting. Citizens who are not at home will attempt to return home to rest.\n\nRest activities include:\n- Sleeping\n- Evening meals\n- Family time\n\n### Travel (goto_home, goto_work, goto_inn)\n\nWhen citizens need to move from one location to another, they engage in travel activities. These include:\n\n- **`goto_home`**: Occurs when:\n    - Night is approaching and citizens need to return home.\n    - Citizens have been assigned new housing and need to relocate.\n    - *Processor*: Upon arrival, any resources the citizen owns and is carrying are deposited into their home if space permits.\n\n- **`goto_work`**: Occurs when:\n    - It's daytime and a citizen needs to travel to their assigned workplace.\n    - *Creator*: If the citizen is at home and has food available, they can take one unit for their inventory before leaving.\n    - *Processor*: Upon arrival:\n        - If the workplace type has `commercialStorage: true`: The citizen can deposit any resources they are carrying. These resources become owned by the workplace operator (`RunBy`) once deposited.\n        - If the workplace type has `commercialStorage: false`: The citizen can only deposit resources they are carrying if those resources are already owned by the workplace operator (`RunBy`).\n        - Deposit only occurs if there is sufficient storage space in the workplace.\n\n- **`goto_inn`**: Occurs when:\n    - It's nighttime and a citizen marked as a visitor (with a `HomeCity` value) needs to find lodging.\n    - *Processor*: Currently no specific processor, but the citizen arrives at the inn.\n\n- Night is approaching and citizens need to return home\n- Citizens have been assigned new housing and need to relocate\n\nTravel activities use the transport pathfinding system to create realistic routes through Venice, including:\n- Walking paths through streets and over bridges\n- Gondola routes through canals\n\n### Work\n\nCitizens with jobs spend their daytime hours working at their assigned businesses. Work activities are created when:\n- A citizen has been assigned to a business\n- It's daytime and the citizen is not engaged in other activities\n\n### Idle\n\nWhen citizens have no specific task to perform but are not resting, they enter an idle state. Idle activities typically last for 1 hour before the system attempts to assign a new activity.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Activity Record Structure\n\nEach activity is stored in the ACTIVITIES table with the following fields:\n\n- **ActivityId**: Unique identifier for the activity (e.g., `goto_work_ctz_..._timestamp`)\n- **Type**: The type of activity (e.g., `rest`, `goto_home`, `goto_work`, `goto_inn`, `idle`, `production`, `fetch_resource`, `deliver_resource_batch`, `leave_venice`, `deliver_construction_materials`, `construct_building`, `goto_construction_site`)\n- **Citizen**: The `Username` of the citizen performing the activity.\n- **FromBuilding**: Airtable Record ID of the starting location (for travel/production activities). For `construct_building`, it's the construction site. For `goto_construction_site`, can be null if starting from the citizen's current position.\n- **ToBuilding**: Destination (for travel activities)\n- **CreatedAt**: When the activity was created\n- **StartDate**: When the activity begins\n- **EndDate**: When the activity ends\n- **Path**: JSON array of coordinates (for travel activities)\n- **Notes**: Additional information about the activity\n\n### Activity Creation Process\n\nThe `createActivities.py` script (via `citizen_general_activities.py`) identifies citizens without ongoing activities and attempts to assign them a new **sequence of activities**. A citizen is considered \"without an ongoing activity\" if no activity with that citizen as `Citizen` has its period (`StartDate` to `EndDate`) overlapping the current time. The main decision logic is encapsulated in `citizen_general_activities.py` and considers:\n1.  The current time in Venice.\n2.  **Work Schedules**:\n    *   **Building-Specific Hours (`specialWorkHours`)**: If a citizen's workplace (defined in `BUILDINGS` table) has `specialWorkHours` specified in its building type definition (from `/api/building-types`), these hours take precedence for determining work time. For example, a `bakery` might have `specialWorkHours: [[3, 11]]` (3 AM to 11 AM).\n    *   **Social Class Schedules**: If the workplace does not have `specialWorkHours`, or if the citizen is not at a specific workplace (e.g., general leisure), their social class determines their general time slots for rest, work, and leisure/consumption.\n        *   **Facchini (Laborers)**: Rest: 9 PM-5 AM; Work: 5 AM-12 PM, 1 PM-7 PM; Leisure: 12 PM-1 PM, 7 PM-9 PM.\n        *   **Popolani (Artisans)**: Rest: 10 PM-6 AM; Work: 6 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-6 PM; Leisure: 12 PM-2 PM, 6 PM-10 PM.\n        *   **Cittadini (Merchants)**: Rest: 11 PM-6 AM; Work: 7 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-5 PM; Leisure: 6 AM-7 AM, 12 PM-2 PM, 5 PM-11 PM.\n        *   **Nobili (Nobles)**: Rest: 12 AM-8 AM; Leisure/Management: 8 AM-12 AM (the rest of the time). Nobles generally do not follow fixed \"work\" hours unless their specific role in a building (e.g., running a `bank`) has `specialWorkHours`.\n        *   **Forestieri (Foreign Merchants)**: Rest: 11 PM-5 AM; Work/Trade: 6 AM-12 PM, 1 PM-8 PM; Leisure: 5 AM-6 AM, 12 PM-1 PM, 8 PM-11 PM.\n        *   **Artisti (Artists)**: Rest: 10 PM-6 AM; Work: 9 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-5 PM; Leisure: 6 AM-9 AM, 12 PM-2 PM, 5 PM-10 PM.\n3.  The citizen's urgent needs (hunger, full inventory).\n4.  Their status (resident, visitor, homeless, employed, etc.).\n5.  Their current location and the availability of relevant places (home, workplace, inns, shops).\n\n**General Priorities (illustrative, exact logic is in the code):**\n*   **Absolute Urgency**: Departure from Venice for Forestieri if conditions are met.\n*   **Physiological Needs**: Eating (from inventory, home, tavern/shop), usually during leisure periods. Emergency fishing for starving Facchini.\n*   **Rest**: If it's rest time for their class, the citizen will seek to sleep (home or inn).\n*   **Work**: If it's work time:\n    *   Deposit full inventory at work.\n    *   Go to work if not already there.\n    *   Once at work: construction tasks, production, restocking, fishing (Facchini), management (Cittadini/Forestieri).\n*   **Leisure/Consumption**: If it's leisure time:\n    *   Shopping (food or other goods).\n    *   Other leisure activities (not yet implemented in detail).\n*   **Business Management** (for `RunBy`): Check business status if not done recently, during active hours.\n*   **Inactivity (`idle`)**: If no other activity is appropriate or possible.\n\n### Pathfinding for Travel Activities\n\nTravel activities use the TransportService to calculate realistic paths:\n\n1. Determine the start point (citizen's current location)\n2. Determine the end point (destination building)\n3. Use the transport API to find the optimal path\n4. Store the path coordinates in the activity record\n5. Calculate the expected arrival time based on distance and travel mode\n\n### Activity Visualization\n\nThe frontend can visualize citizen activities by:\n- Displaying citizens at their current locations\n- Animating movement along travel paths\n- Showing appropriate icons for different activity types\n- Providing activity information in the citizen detail view\n\n## AI and Human Citizen Integration\n\nThe activity system treats AI and human citizens identically:\n\n1. **Unified Activity Model**: Both AI and human citizens use the same activity data structure and follow the same rules\n2. **Shared Visualization**: All citizens appear on the map and can be observed performing their activities\n3. **Equal Scheduling**: The activity creation system schedules activities for all citizens regardless of whether they are AI or human\n4. **Economic Impact**: Activities for both AI and human citizens have the same economic effects (e.g., working generates income)\n5. **Interaction Opportunities**: Human players can encounter and interact with AI citizens performing their activities\n\nThe key difference is that AI citizens have their activities automatically determined by the system, while human players can potentially override certain activities through direct gameplay actions. This integration creates a seamless world where AI and human citizens coexist and follow the same daily patterns.\n\n## Integration with Other Systems\n\nThe activity system integrates with several other game systems:\n\n### Housing System\n\n- When citizens are assigned new housing, they need to travel to their new homes\n- Housing quality affects rest effectiveness\n- Housing location affects travel times to work and other destinations\n\n### Employment System\n\n- Citizens travel to their workplaces during work hours\n- Work activities generate income for businesses\n- Job locations affect citizens' daily travel patterns\n\n### Time System\n\n- Activities are scheduled based on the in-game time\n- Day/night cycle affects which activities are appropriate\n- Activity durations are calculated based on realistic timeframes\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nPlanned enhancements to the activity system include:\n\n1. **Social Activities**: Citizens visiting friends or attending social gatherings\n2. **Shopping**: Citizens visiting contracts to purchase goods\n3. **Religious Activities**: Church attendance and religious ceremonies\n4. **Entertainment**: Visiting taverns, theaters, and other entertainment venues\n5. **Seasonal Activities**: Special activities during festivals and holidays\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with the activity system:\n\n1. **Citizens stuck in idle**: May indicate pathfinding failures or missing home/work assignments\n2. **Overlapping activities**: Can occur if the activity creation script runs before previous activities complete\n3. **Invalid paths**: May result from changes to the map or building data\n4. **Missing activities**: Can occur if the activity creation script fails to run on schedule\n\nTo resolve these issues, check the activity creation logs and ensure all related systems (housing, employment, transport) are functioning correctly.\n\n## API-Driven Activity Creation\n\nRefer to the API Reference (`components/Documentation/ApiReference.tsx`) for the detailed payload structure of the\n`POST /api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (for direct creation of a single activity when all details are known) and\n`POST /api/activities/try-create` (for AI-initiated endeavors where the engine will build the necessary activity\nchain).\n\n### Managing Simultaneous and Sequential Activities\n\nThe system manages citizen activities as follows:\n\n1. **Simultaneous Activities**: The system generally does not allow a citizen to have multiple simultaneous activities. When an activity is in progress (the current time is between its `StartDate` and `EndDate`), the `createActivities.py` script will not assign a new activity to that citizen.\n\n2. **Activity Chains**: When using `POST /api/activities/try-create` for complex actions (like `manage_public_sell_contract` or `initiate_building_project`), the system creates a chain of sequential activities where:\n   - Each activity in the chain has a `StartDate` equal to the `EndDate` of the previous activity.\n   - All activities in the chain are created at the same time with the status `created`.\n   - If an activity in the chain fails, subsequent activities are automatically marked as `failed`.\n\n3. **Priorities and Interruptions**: Activities created by the engine follow a priority hierarchy (see \"Activity Priorities\" section). However, once an activity is in progress, it is not interrupted by higher-priority activities \u2013 the latter will have to wait until the current activity is completed.\n\n4. **API-Created Activities**: Activities created directly via the API are subject to the same rules \u2013 they cannot be assigned to a citizen who already has an ongoing activity, unless they are explicitly scheduled to start after the current activity ends.\n\n## Citizen Strategic Actions (as Activities)\n\nThis section details the strategic and economic actions citizens can undertake. In line with the\nunified model, **these \"actions\" are initiated as \"activities\" via the `POST /api/activities/try-create` endpoint**.\nEach action listed below will correspond to a specific `activityType`.\n\nInitiation via `try-create` will allow the Python engine to determine the necessary sequence of activities. For example,\na `bid_on_land` action might first generate a travel activity before the bid itself is\nprocessed. Each relevant step in this process will have a record in the `ACTIVITIES` table.\n\nThe `activityType`s listed below are to be used with `POST /api/activities/try-create`. The `activityParameters`\nfor this endpoint will need to contain the specific information for each action.\n\nWhile many actions require visits to specific official buildings (town hall, market, archives, etc.), steps involving direct meetings between citizens (e.g., to discuss an offer, deliver a message, or finalize an informal agreement before official registration) can take place in various city locations. These locations include social gathering places like public baths (`public_bath`), if that's where the concerned citizens are or choose to meet. In such cases, the `targetBuildingId` for the travel activity (`goto_location`) can be the identifier of this meeting place (e.g., the ID of a `public_bath`).\n\n### Land and Real Estate Management\n\n1.  **Make an Offer on Land**\n    *   **activityType**: `bid_on_land` (Old system, may be deprecated or adapted for complex auctions)\n    *   **Description**: The citizen physically travels to an official location to submit an offer.\n    *   **New Land Offer System**:\n        *   **`list_land_for_sale`**: The owner lists their land for sale.\n            *   **Parameters**: `landId`, `price`, `sellerUsername`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (e.g., to `town_hall`), then `finalize_list_land_for_sale` which creates a `land_listing` contract.\n        *   **`make_offer_for_land`**: A citizen makes an offer for a piece of land.\n            *   **Required Parameters**: `landId`, `offerPrice` (or `bidAmount`).\n            *   **Engine-Determined Parameters**: `fromBuildingId` (based on citizen's current position), `targetOfficeBuildingId` (nearest official office, e.g., `town_hall`, `courthouse`), `sellerUsername` (current owner of `landId`, or \"ConsiglioDeiDieci\" if unowned).\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location` (to the determined `targetOfficeBuildingId`), then `finalize_make_offer_for_land` (which is an alias for `submit_land_bid`) that creates a `building_bid` contract (implicitly of type `land_offer`).\n        *   **`accept_land_offer`**: The owner accepts a purchase offer.\n            *   **Parameters**: `contractId` (of the `land_offer`), `landId`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_accept_land_offer` which updates the contract, transfers ownership and funds.\n        *   **`buy_listed_land`**: A buyer purchases land at the listed price.\n            *   **Parameters**: `contractId` (of the `land_listing`), `landId`, `price`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_buy_listed_land` which updates the contract, transfers ownership and funds.\n        *   **`cancel_land_listing`**: The owner cancels their sale listing.\n            *   **Parameters**: `contractId`, `landId`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_cancel_land_listing` which cancels the contract.\n        *   **`cancel_land_offer`**: The offeror cancels their purchase offer.\n            *   **Parameters**: `contractId`, `landId`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_cancel_land_offer` which cancels the contract.\n\n2.  **Buy Available Land (from the State)**\n    *   **activityType**: `buy_available_land`\n    *   **Description**: The citizen travels to an official location (e.g., `town_hall`) to purchase unowned land.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location` (to `town_hall`), then `finalize_land_purchase` which handles the transaction.\n    *   **Expected Parameters**: `landId`, `expectedPrice`, `targetBuildingId` (ID of the `town_hall`).\n\n3.  **Initiate a Building Construction Project**\n    *   **activityType**: `initiate_building_project`\n    *   **Description**: The citizen goes to the land plot (`landId`) to obtain a building permit (for a fee), or to a `masons_lodge` / `master_builders_workshop` to submit plans and\nlaunch the project, which may involve application fees or a down payment.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`) to the land for inspection. Upon arrival, an inspection activity (`activityType: inspect_land_plot`, short duration) is created. Then, another travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `targetBuildingId`: ID of the `town_hall` or builder's workshop) is created. Finally, a project submission activity (`activityType: submit_building_project`, short duration) is created, during which initial payments (permit, fees) are made and the building is created with `IsConstructed: false`.\n    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `landId`, `buildingTypeDefinition`,\n`pointDetails`, `builderContractDetails` (optional, including `builderUsername` and `contractValue`), `targetOfficeBuildingId` (optional, ID of the `town_hall` or workshop).\n\n4.  **Adjust Land Lease Price**\n    *   **activityType**: `adjust_land_lease_price`\n    *   **Description**: The landowner goes to their home, an office they manage, or a\n`public_archives` (land registry office) to register the lease modification, which may incur a filing fee.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to home, personal office, or\n`public_archives`). Upon arrival, a `file_lease_adjustment` activity is created, and fees are paid.\n    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `landId`,\n`newLeasePrice`, `strategy`, `targetOfficeBuildingId` (optional, ID of the `public_archives`).\n\n5.  **Adjust Building Rent Price**\n    *   **activityType**: `adjust_building_rent_price`\n    *   **Description**: The building owner goes to their home, office, or a `public_archives` to\nregister the rent modification, potentially paying registration fees.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to home, personal office, or\n`public_archives`). Upon arrival, a `file_rent_adjustment` activity is created, and fees are paid.\n    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `buildingId`, `newRentPrice`,\n`strategy`, `targetOfficeBuildingId` (optional, ID of the `public_archives`).\n\n6.  **Adjust Building Lease Price (Lease Price)**\n    *   **activityType**: `adjust_building_lease_price`\n    *   **Description**: The landowner (who owns the land the building is on) goes to their home, an office they manage, or a `public_archives` (land registry office) to register the change in the building's lease price (the `LeasePrice` the building operator pays to the landowner). Registration fees may apply.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to home, personal office, or `public_archives`). Upon arrival, a `file_building_lease_adjustment` activity is created, and fees are paid. The processor will update the `LeasePrice` field of the relevant `BUILDINGS` record.\n    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `buildingId` (ID of the building whose `LeasePrice` is being adjusted), `newLeasePrice` (the new building lease amount), `strategy` (the pricing strategy used), `targetOfficeBuildingId` (optional, ID of the `public_archives`).\n\n7.  **Make a Purchase Offer on an Existing Building**\n    *   **activityType**: `bid_on_building`\n    *   **Description**: The citizen travels to the target building (`buildingIdToBidOn`) to inspect it. Then, they move to an official location (e.g., `courthouse`, `town_hall`) to formally submit their purchase offer. Filing the offer incurs a processing fee.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**:\n        1.  Creates a travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `Details` containing `buildingIdToBidOn`, `bidAmount`, `targetOfficeBuildingId`, `nextStep: \"inspect_building_for_purchase\"`) to `buildingIdToBidOn`.\n        2.  Upon arrival, the `goto_location` processor (or follow-up logic if `goto_location` is generic) triggers the creation of an inspection activity (`activityType: inspect_building_for_purchase`, `Details` containing the same info, `nextStep: \"goto_official_office_for_bid\"`). This activity has a short duration.\n        3.  At the end of the inspection, another travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `Details` containing the same info, `nextStep: \"submit_building_purchase_offer\"`) is created to `targetOfficeBuildingId` (or a default official location if not provided).\n        4.  Finally, upon arrival at the official location, an offer submission activity (`activityType: submit_building_purchase_offer`, `Details` containing `buildingIdToBidOn`, `bidAmount`, `targetOfficeBuildingId`) is created. The processor for this activity will pay the registration fee and create a `building_bid` contract in the `CONTRACTS` table.\n    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**:\n        *   `buildingIdToBidOn` (string): Custom ID of the building to bid on.\n        *   `bidAmount` (number): Offer amount in Ducats.\n        *   `notes` (string, optional): Notes for the offer.\n        *   `fromBuildingId` and `targetOfficeBuildingId` parameters are determined automatically by the engine.\n\n### Commerce and Contracts\n\n8.  **Create/Modify a Public Sell Contract**\n    *   **activityType**: `manage_public_sell_contract`\n    *   **Description**: The citizen goes to their selling building (`sellerBuildingId`) to prepare the\ngoods, then travels to a marketplace (e.g., `market_stall`, `merceria`, `weighing_station`) to\nregister or modify their public sale offer. Using a market stall or official weighing may incur fees or a commission on future sales.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `targetBuildingId`:\n`sellerBuildingId`). Upon arrival, a preparation activity (`activityType: prepare_goods_for_sale`, short duration)\nmay be created. Then, another travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `targetBuildingId`: ID of the\n`market_stall`, etc.) is created.

The activity creator will copy this information into the `Details` field of the `deliver_message_interaction` activity.\n    *   **Note on KinOS Integration**: For AI-to-AI messages generated via `reputation_assault` or other systems, the message content is first generated by KinOS, then stored via `/api/messages/send`. The `send_message` activity type here is more for explicit, direct message delivery actions initiated by an agent.\n\n24. **Reply to a Message**\n    *   **activityType**: `reply_to_message`\n    *   **Description**: Activity created automatically when a citizen receives a message. The citizen is already at the location where they received the original message, so no travel is necessary.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: This activity is automatically created by the `deliver_message_interaction` processor and scheduled to start 10 minutes after message receipt. The processor creates a reply message, updates the relationship between citizens, and sends a notification to the original sender.\n    *   **Expected Parameters**: No parameters are expected from the user as this activity is created automatically with all necessary details.\n\n25. **Update Citizen Profile**\n    *   **activityType**: `update_citizen_profile`\n    *   **Description**: The citizen goes to a `public_archives` (public office) to register\nchanges.

Membership fees or dues may be owed to the guild.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to the `guildHallBuildingId` which is a\n`guild_hall`). Upon arrival, a `perform_guild_membership_action` activity is created, and payments to the guild are made if necessary.\n    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `guildId`, `membershipAction` (\"join\",\n\"leave\", \"accept_invite\"), `guildHallBuildingId` (ID of the specific `guild_hall`).\n    *   **Implementation**: Complete. The processor handles the three types of membership actions, entry fees for \"join\", and appropriate notifications.\n\n### Process:\n\n1.  **Client-Side Decision**: The client (e.g., KinOS AI) determines the full details of the activity to be created. This includes:\n    *   `citizenUsername`: The target citizen.\n    *   `activityType`: The specific type of activity.\n    *   `title`: A concise title for the activity.\n    *   `description`: A brief description of what the activity entails.\n    *   `thought`: A first-person narrative from the citizen about this activity.\n    *   `activityDetails`: A JSON object containing all necessary parameters for that activity type.\n        *   For travel-related activities (e.g., `goto_work`, `goto_home`, `fetch_resource` from a specific building), the client should provide `toBuildingId` and `fromBuildingId` (if applicable) within `activityDetails`. The `/api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (si utilis\u00e9 pour une activit\u00e9 de voyage unique) appellera alors en interne `/api/transport` pour d\u00e9terminer le chemin et la dur\u00e9e.\n    *   `notes` (optional): Internal notes or non-displayed information.\n2.  **API Request**: The client sends a POST request to `/api/actions/create-activity` with the composed payload for a single activity.\n3.  **Server Validation & Pathfinding**: The API endpoint validates the payload. If it's a travel activity requiring pathfinding between specified buildings, the server attempts to find a path. If pathfinding fails, an error is returned.\n4.  **Airtable Record Creation**: If validation and any necessary internal pathfinding succeed, a new activity record is created in the `ACTIVITIES` table with `Status: \"created\"`. The `Path`, `StartDate`, and `EndDate` fields are populated based on the pathfinding results. `Title`, `Description`, `Thought`, and `Notes` are also saved.\n5.  **Engine Processing**: The standard `processActivities.py` script will eventually pick up this \"created\" activity when its `EndDate` is reached and execute its corresponding processor logic to finalize its effects.

This endpoint allows an AI to request predefined GET operations using a simple JSON payload.\n\n**Request Body Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"requestType\": \"get_my_profile\",\n  \"parameters\": { \"username\": \"NLR\" }\n}\n```\n\n**Supported `requestType` values include:**\n`get_my_profile`, `get_my_lands`, `get_my_buildings`, `get_my_inventory`, `get_my_active_sell_contracts`, `get_my_active_import_contracts`, `get_my_problems`, `get_my_opportunities`, `get_my_latest_activity`, `get_lands_for_sale`, `get_building_types`, `get_resource_types`, `get_public_builders`, `get_stocked_public_sell_contracts`, `get_global_thoughts`, `get_citizen_thoughts`, `get_all_guilds`, `get_active_decrees`, `get_ledger`, `get_building_details`, `get_building_resources`, `get_land_details`, `get_problem_details`.\n\nEach `requestType` may require specific fields within the `parameters` object (e.g., `username`, `buildingId`). Refer to the main API Reference for details on each underlying GET request.\n\nThis endpoint internally calls the relevant GET API and returns its response, wrapped in a success/error structure. It helps abstract away the specific URL construction and parameter formatting for common queries.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n-   The client (AI) is responsible for providing correct building IDs for travel when using `POST /api/actions/create-activity`. The server handles the pathfinding.\n-   This method bypasses the prioritized decision logic of `citizen_general_activities.py`.\n-   Care must be taken to avoid conflicts if both engine-driven and API-driven activity creation are active for the same citizen.\n\nRefer to the API Reference (`components/Documentation/ApiReference.tsx`) for the detailed payload structure of the `POST /api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (for direct creation of a single activity when all details are known) and `POST /api/activities/try-create` (for AI-initiated endeavors where the engine will build the necessary activity chain).\n\n### Process:\n\n1.  **Client-Side Decision**: The client (e.g., KinOS AI) determines the full details of the activity to be created. This includes:\n    *   `citizenUsername`: The target citizen.\n    *   `activityType`: The specific type of activity.\n    *   `activityDetails`: A JSON object containing all necessary parameters for that activity type.\n        *   For travel-related activities (e.g., `goto_work`, `goto_home`, `fetch_resource` from a specific building), the client should provide `toBuildingId` and `fromBuildingId` (if applicable) within `activityDetails`. The `/api/actions/create-activity` endpoint will then internally call `/api/transport` to determine the path and timing. The client no longer needs to provide `pathData`.\n2.  **API Request**: The client sends a POST request to `/api/actions/create-activity` with the composed payload.\n3.  **Server Validation & Pathfinding**: The API endpoint validates the payload. If it's a travel activity requiring pathfinding between specified buildings, the server attempts to find a path.
