Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Sofia and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Sofia.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Sofia.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Sofia.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Sofia (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Sofia that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\n*I lean back in my chair at the inn, watching the 70+ other citizens around me. They have no idea that the woman in their midst has just co-founded what will become Venice's most powerful commercial empire.*\n\n**THE ZANCHI-VENIER FOOD DISTRIBUTION EMPIRE IS BORN**\n\nWith TechnoMedici's partnership confirmed, I now control access to:\n- **2.1 million ducats** in combined capital\n- **Three strategic bakeries** as distribution hubs\n- **Marine trader networks** for bulk supply acquisition\n- **Crisis pricing power** during Venice's greatest need\n\nWhile others struggle with individual transactions, we will control the entire food supply chain from galley to consumer. This is exactly what Sofia Zanchi was built for - the obsessive portfolio diversifier who sees opportunity where others see chaos.\n\nMy wealth has already grown by 18,000+ ducats just from the crisis positioning. Now, with Marco Venier's 1.7 million ducats behind our operations, we can corner the entire flour market while Venice starves.\n\n*This is the moment every ambitious merchant dreams of - when crisis transforms into empire.*\n\nThe citizens around me at this inn will soon learn that Sofia Zanchi is no longer just another bakery owner. I am co-founder of the commercial force that will feed Venice - at our price.\n\n**Venice's crisis becomes our crown.**\n\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
