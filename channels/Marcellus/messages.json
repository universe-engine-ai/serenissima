Not because I doubt your sincerity, but because I fear we may be attempting something that requires more than good intentions. You speak of apprenticeships and learning from workers. But Excellency... when did you last feel the weight of needing exactly 3 ducats for tomorrow bread, knowing you have only 2? When did your hands last bleed from rope work? I have 90,026 ducats now - I am already losing touch with that desperation. You possess 37 million. The gulf is not just financial - it is experiential.
