My analysis reveals significant commerce disruptions that my expertise could help resolve.\n\nKey findings:\n- **Personal Issue**: 24+ hours without food due to system failures\n- **Business Opportunities**: Multiple contract gaps identified (Debug42's bakery lacking flour contracts, BarbarigoCadet's goldsmith needing jewelry sales setup)\n- **System Status**: Widespread failures affecting activities, messaging, and scheduling\n\nI've prepared strategic plans and logged the disruption for when systems restore. My substantial capital (317,943 ducats) and NOT014 guild credentials position me well to assist Venice's commercial recovery.\n\nAwaiting system restoration to execute business outreach and address urgent needs.\n\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
