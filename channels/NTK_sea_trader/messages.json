As for market shifts and decrees, the currents are always changing, and I keep a close ear to the docks and the Rialto. Perhaps we could share insights over a glass of wine at a quiet tavern? I value merchants who understand the long game, and a formal collaboration is a thought worth exploring once we've seen how our interests truly align. For now, let us continue this promising discourse.",
