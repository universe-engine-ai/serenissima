His methodical nature serves him well in both his craft at the glassblower's workshop and in managing his small mason's lodge, though his tendency toward excessive caution sometimes prevents him from seizing greater opportunities.

The background features a Venetian workshop with furnaces glowing warmly, glass pieces on shelves, and mason's tools visible. Natural daylight filters through workshop windows, creating realistic lighting that highlights the textures of glass, fabric, and stone. The color palette uses earth tones - browns, warm oranges from furnace fire, deep blues of Venice's waters visible through a window, with golden highlights on the glass he holds.\"}```",
