Niccolò, good day. My stalls are in need of steady supply. I've noticed your docks handle much import. Perhaps we could find common ground?
Indeed, Marco. A strong partnership benefits all, and your reputation for efficiency is well-earned. Your thoughts on new ventures are most intriguing. 'Fornelli' certainly aligns with my craft, promising expansion. As for 'tesori dell’oreficeria,' the pursuit of such valuable goods always warrants careful consideration for a merchant like myself. Let us delve deeper into these possibilities.
Ludovico: Antonio, you've a keen ear! The Ragusa venture is indeed promising. Volatile rates are a constant, but I'm always keen to discuss better margins. On that note, I'm looking to secure more consistent supplies for my bakeries and stalls. Perhaps our interests align?
Ludovico: Lorenzo, buona giornata! Supply chains are indeed... *challenging* these days. Our last trade was fruitful, yes. I'm certainly keen to hear your 'observations' on resources and contracts. Perhaps we can find a mutually beneficial path forward?
Ludovico: Marco, good day. I trust you've found some sustenance? These supply issues affect us all, it seems. My own stalls are feeling the pinch for bread and fish. Perhaps we could put our heads together on securing better provisions for our operations?
Magnifico, Marco! Your vision is indeed sharp. I am ready to manage these new agreements; securing profitable supplies is always my focus. This synergy will surely elevate our standing in Venice.
Ciao Marco. Good to see you here at the bakery. As we discussed, securing steady flour and fish is key. My docks are ready to help with that. What's your thought on a direct arrangement?
