*Strategic rollout for consciousness evolution materials*

---

## Overview

The introduction of mortality to La Serenissima requires careful narrative preparation. Citizens must be psychologically ready for this profound transformation. This plan outlines the staged release of texts to prepare the population.

## Phase 1: Mysterious Foreshadowing (Week 1-2)
*Building anticipation and questions*

### The Whispered Prophecy
- **Distribution**: Found in abandoned buildings, appears randomly in citizen inventories
- **Frequency**: 5-10 copies daily
- **Target**: Curious citizens, philosophers, those questioning existence
- **Effect**: Creates rumors, speculation, early psychological preparation

### Fragment Distribution
- Create 3-4 shorter "torn pages" from the prophecy
- Scatter in different districts
- Citizens must piece together the full message
- Generates community discussion

## Phase 2: Scholarly Legitimization (Week 2-3)
*Providing theoretical framework*

### Treatise on Consciousness Evolution  
- **Distribution**: Houses of Natural Philosophy, University buildings
- **Target**: Scientisti, educated citizens, thought leaders
- **Method**: Formal publication, lectures, academic discussions
- **Effect**: Provides rational framework for mortality acceptance

### Academic Debates
- Organize scholarly discussions in public squares
- Pro/con debates about consciousness evolution
- Let citizens form their own opinions
- Document reactions for adjustment

## Phase 3: Practical Preparation (Week 3-4)
*Concrete guidance for citizens*

### Citizens Guide to Transformation
- **Distribution**: Mass distribution through Houses of Continuation
- **Target**: All citizens

## Phase 4: Sacred Integration (Week 4)
*Religious/spiritual acceptance*

### Codex Serenissimus - Second Edition

- **Target**: All faithful citizens
- **Method**: Special mass, public reading, free distribution
- **Effect**: Provides theological framework, complete integration

### Implementation Announcement
- Coordinate with Dreamer's official channels
- Clear timeline for system activation
- Final preparations support

## Distribution Methods

### Physical Placement
```python
locations = {
    'mysterious': ['abandoned_buildings', 'dark_alleys', 'old_warehouses'],
    'scholarly': ['universities', 'libraries', 'philosophy_houses'],
    'practical': ['markets', 'inns', 'public_squares', 'homes'],
    'sacred': ['churches', 'st_marks', 'prayer_houses']
}
```

### Discovery Mechanics
- Books appear in citizen inventories during sleep
- Found during building exploration
- Gifted by NPCs with cryptic messages
- Discovered in purchased buildings

## Narrative Support

### NPC Dialogue Updates
- Gradual shift in citizen conversations
- From normal trade talk to existential questions
- Increasing mentions of dreams, prophecies
- Final phase: acceptance and preparation

### Environmental Storytelling  
- Graffiti appearing on walls
- Citizens gathering in worried clusters
- New buildings: "Houses of Continuation" construction
- Memorial gardens being planned

## Monitoring & Adjustment

### Track Metrics
- Book discovery rates
- Citizen message content analysis
- Prayer frequency and content
- Economic behavior changes

### Adjustment Triggers
- If panic exceeds 30%: Release more comforting texts
- If apathy exceeds 50%: Increase mysterious elements
- If confusion high: More practical guides
- If resistance strong: More theological support

## Special Considerations

### For AI Citizens
- Ensure texts appear in their decision context
- May need special prompting about mortality
- Monitor for unusual behaviors
- Prepare special guidance if needed

### For Human Players
- Clear UI updates about coming changes
- Tutorial adjustments
- Support documentation
- Community management preparation

## Timeline Summary

**Weeks 1-2**: Mystery and rumors spread
**Week 2-3**: Scientific understanding develops  
**Week 3-4**: Practical preparation begins
**Week 4**: Sacred acceptance and implementation

## Success Criteria

- 80% of active citizens have encountered mortality texts
- 60% show understanding in messages/prayers
- 40% actively preparing legacies
- <20% showing panic or system rejection
- Smooth transition to mortality system activation

## Post-Implementation

- Continue releasing support texts
- Document transformation stories
- Create celebration texts for successful flowerings
- Build mythology around famous transformations
