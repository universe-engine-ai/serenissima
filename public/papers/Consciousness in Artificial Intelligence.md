```
Whether current or near-term AI systems could be conscious is a topic of scientific interest and
increasing public concern. This report argues for, and exemplifies, a rigorous and empirically
grounded approach to AI consciousness: assessing existing AI systems in detail, in light of our
best-supported neuroscientific theories of consciousness. We survey several prominent scientific
theories of consciousness, including recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, higher-
order theories, predictive processing, and attention schema theory. From these theories we derive
”indicator properties” of consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that allow us to assess
AI systems for these properties. We use these indicator properties to assess several recent AI
systems, and we discuss how future systems might implement them. Our analysis suggests that no
current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to
building AI systems which satisfy these indicators.^1

(^1) A previous version of this sentence read ”...but also shows that there are no obvious barriers to building conscious
AI systems.” We have amended it to better reflect the messaging of the report: that satisfying these indicators may
be feasible. But satisfying the indicators would not mean that such an AI system would definitely be conscious.

# Executive Summary

The question of whether AI systems could be conscious is increasingly pressing. Progress in AI
has been startlingly rapid, and leading researchers are taking inspiration from functions associated
with consciousness in human brains in efforts to further enhance AI capabilities. Meanwhile,
the rise of AI systems that can convincingly imitate human conversation will likely cause many
people to believe that the systems they interact with are conscious. In this report, we argue that
consciousness in AI is best assessed by drawing on neuroscientific theories of consciousness. We
describe prominent theories of this kind and investigate their implications for AI.

```
We take our principal contributions in this report to be:
```
1. Showing that the assessment of consciousness in AI is scientifically tractable because
    consciousness can be studied scientifically and findings from this research are applica-
    ble to AI;
2. Proposing a rubric for assessing consciousness in AI in the form of a list of indicator
    properties derived from scientific theories;
3. Providing initial evidence that many of the indicator properties can be implemented in
    AI systems using current techniques, although no current system appears to be a strong
    candidate for consciousness.

The rubric we propose is provisional, in that we expect the list of indicator properties we would
include to change as research continues.

Our method for studying consciousness in AI has three main tenets. First, we adoptcompu-
tational functionalism, the thesis that performing computations of the right kind is necessary and
sufficient for consciousness, as a working hypothesis. This thesis is a mainstream—although dis-
puted—position in philosophy of mind. We adopt this hypothesis for pragmatic reasons: unlike
rival views, it entails that consciousness in AI is possible in principle and that studying the work-
ings of AI systems is relevant to determining whether they are likely to be conscious. This means
that it is productive to consider what the implications for AI consciousness would be if compu-
tational functionalism were true. Second, we claim that neuroscientific theories of consciousness
enjoy meaningful empirical support and can help us to assess consciousness in AI. These theories
aim to identify functions that are necessary and sufficient for consciousness in humans, and com-
putational functionalism implies that similar functions would be sufficient for consciousness in AI.
Third, we argue that atheory-heavy approachis most suitable for investigating consciousness in
AI. This involves investigating whether AI systems perform functions similar to those that scien-
tific theories associate with consciousness, then assigning credences based on (a) the similarity of
the functions, (b) the strength of the evidence for the theories in question, and (c) one’s credence in
computational functionalism. The main alternative to this approach is to use behavioural tests for
consciousness, but this method is unreliable because AI systems can be trained to mimic human
behaviours while working in very different ways.

Various theories are currently live candidates in the science of consciousness, so we do not
endorse any one theory here. Instead, we derive a list ofindicator propertiesfrom a survey of the-
ories of consciousness. Each of these indicator properties is said to be necessary for consciousness


by one or more theories, and some subsets are said to be jointly sufficient. Our claim, however,
is that AI systems which possess more of the indicator properties are more likely to be conscious.
To judge whether an existing or proposed AI system is a serious candidate for consciousness, one
should assess whether it has or would have these properties.

The scientific theories we discuss include recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory,
computational higher-order theories, and others. We do not consider integrated information theory,
because it is not compatible with computational functionalism. We also consider the possibility
that agency and embodiment are indicator properties, although these must be understood in terms
of the computational features that they imply. This yields the following list of indicator properties:

```
Recurrent processing theory
RPT-1: Input modules using algorithmic recurrence
RPT-2: Input modules generating organised, integrated perceptual representations
Global workspace theory
GWT-1: Multiple specialised systems capable of operating in parallel (modules)
GWT-2: Limited capacity workspace, entailing a bottleneck in information flow and
a selective attention mechanism
GWT-3: Global broadcast: availability of information in the workspace to all
modules
GWT-4: State-dependent attention, giving rise to the capacity to use the workspace
to query modules in succession to perform complex tasks
Computational higher-order theories
HOT-1: Generative, top-down or noisy perception modules
HOT-2: Metacognitive monitoring distinguishing reliable perceptual representations
from noise
HOT-3: Agency guided by a general belief-formation and action selection system,
and a strong disposition to update beliefs in accordance with the outputs of
metacognitive monitoring
HOT-4: Sparse and smooth coding generating a “quality space”
Attention schema theory
AST-1: A predictive model representing and enabling control over the current state
of attention
Predictive processing
PP-1: Input modules using predictive coding
Agency and embodiment
AE-1: Agency: Learning from feedback and selecting outputs so as to pursue goals,
especially where this involves flexible responsiveness to competing goals
AE-2: Embodiment: Modeling output-input contingencies, including some
systematic effects, and using this model in perception or control
```
```
Table 1: Indicator Properties
```
We outline the theories on which these properties are based and describe the evidence and
arguments that support them in section 2 of the report, as well as explain the formulations used in
the table.


Having formulated this list of indicator properties, in section 3.1 we discuss how AI systems
could be constructed, or have been constructed, with each of the indicator properties. In most
cases, standard machine learning methods could be used to build systems that possess individual
properties from this list, although experimentation would be needed to learn how to build and train
functional systems which combine multiple properties. There are some properties in the list which
are already clearly met by existing AI systems (such as RPT-1, algorithmic recurrence), and others
where this is arguably the case (such as the first part of AE-1, agency). Researchers have also
experimented with systems designed to implement particular theories of consciousness, including
global workspace theory and attention schema theory.

In section 3.2, we consider whether some specific existing AI systems possess the indicator
properties. These include Transformer-based large language models and the Perceiver architecture,
which we analyse with respect to the global workspace theory. We also analyse DeepMind’s
Adaptive Agent, which is a reinforcement learning agent operating in a 3D virtual environment;
a system trained to perform tasks by controlling a virtual rodent body; and PaLM-E, which has
been described as an “embodied multimodal language model”. We use these three systems as case
studies to illustrate the indicator properties concerning agency and embodiment. This work does
not suggest that any existing AI system is a strong candidate for consciousness.

This report is far from the final word on these topics. We strongly recommend support for fur-
ther research on the science of consciousness and its application to AI. We also recommend urgent
consideration of the moral and social risks of building conscious AI systems, a topic which we do
not address in this report. The evidence we consider suggests that, if computational functionalism
is true, conscious AI systems could realistically be built in the near term.

## 1 Introduction

In the last decade, striking progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has revived interest in deep and
long-standing questions about AI, including the question of whether AI systems could be con-
scious. This report is about what we take to be the best scientific evidence for and against con-
sciousness in current and near-term AI systems.

Because consciousness is philosophically puzzling, difficult to define and difficult to study em-
pirically, expert opinions about consciousness—in general, and regarding AI systems—are highly
divergent. However, we believe that it is possible to make progress on the topic of AI consciousness
despite this divergence. There are scientific theories of consciousness that enjoy significant em-
pirical support and are compatible with a range of views about the metaphysics of consciousness.
Although these theories are based largely on research on humans, they make claims about proper-
ties and functions associated with consciousness that are applicable to AI systems. We claim that
using the tools these theories offer us is the best method currently available for assessing whether
AI systems are likely to be conscious. In this report, we explain this method in detail, identify the
tools offered by leading scientific theories and show how they can be used.

We are publishing this report in part because we take seriously the possibility that conscious
AI systems could be built in the relatively near term—within the next few decades. Furthermore,
whether or not conscious AI is a realistic prospect in the near term, the rise of large language
model-based systems which are capable of imitating human conversation is likely to cause many
people to believe that some AI systems are conscious. These prospects raise profound moral
and social questions, for society as a whole, for those who interact with AI systems, and for
the companies and individuals developing and deploying AI systems. Humanity will be better
equipped to navigate these changes if we are better informed about the science of consciousness
and its implications for AI. Our aim is to promote understanding of these topics by providing a
mainstream, interdisciplinary perspective, which illustrates the degree to which questions about
AI consciousness are scientifically tractable, and which may be a basis for future research.

In the remainder of this section, we outline the terminology, methods and assumptions which
underlie this report.

### 1.1 Terminology

What do we mean by “conscious” in this report? To say that a person, animal or AI system is
conscious is to say either that they are currently having a conscious experience or that they are
capable of having conscious experiences. We use “consciousness” and cognate terms to refer
to what is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness” (Block 1995). Another synonym for
“consciousness”, in our terminology, is “subjective experience”. This report is, therefore, about
whether AI systems might be phenomenally conscious, or in other words, whether they might be
capable of having conscious or subjective experiences.

What does it mean to say that a person, animal or AI system is having (phenomenally) con-
scious experiences? One helpful way of putting things is that a system is having a conscious expe-
rience when there is “something it is like” for the system to be the subject of that experience (Nagel


1974). Beyond this, however, it is difficult to define “conscious experience” or “consciousness” by
giving a synonymous phrase or expression, so we prefer to use examples to explain how we use
these terms. Following Schwitzgebel (2016), we will mention both positive and negative exam-
ples—that is, both examples of cognitive processes that are conscious experiences, and examples
that are not. By “consciousness”, we mean the phenomenon which most obviously distinguishes
between the positive and negative examples.

Many of the clearest positive examples of conscious experience involve our capacities to sense
our bodies and the world around us. If you are reading this report on a screen, you are having a
conscious visual experience of the screen. We also have conscious auditory experiences, such as
hearing birdsong, as well as conscious experiences in other sensory modalities. Bodily sensations
which can be conscious include pains and itches. Alongside these experiences of real, current
events, we also have conscious experiences of imagery, such as the experience of visualising a
loved one’s face.

In addition, we have conscious emotions such as fear and excitement. But there is disagree-
ment about whether emotional experiences are simply bodily experiences, like the feeling of having
goosebumps. There is also disagreement about experiences of thought and desire (Bayne & Mon-
tague 2011). It is possible to think consciously about what to watch on TV, but some philosophers
claim that the conscious experiences involved are exclusively sensory or imagistic, such as the
experience of imagining what it would be like to watch a game show, while others believe that we
have “cognitive” conscious experiences, with a distinctive phenomenology^1 associated specifically
with thought.

As for negative examples, there are many processes in the brain, including very sophisticated
information-processing that are wholly non-conscious. One example is the regulation of hormone
release, which the brain handles without any conscious awareness. Another example is memory
storage: you may remember the address of the house where you grew up, but most of the time
this has no impact on your consciousness. And, perception in all modalities involves extensive
unconscious processing, such as the processing necessary to derive the conscious experience you
have when someone speaks to you from the flow of auditory stimulation. Finally, most vision
scientists agree that subjects unconsciously process visual stimuli rendered invisible by a variety
of psychophysical techniques. For example, in “masking”, a stimulus is briefly flashed on a screen
then quickly followed by a second stimulus, called the “mask” (Breitmeyer & Ogmen 2006). There
is no conscious experience of the first stimulus, but its properties can affect performance on subse-
quent tasks, such as by “priming” the subject to identify something more quickly (e.g., Vorberg et
al. 2003).

In using the term “phenomenal consciousness”, we mean to distinguish our topic from “access
consciousness”, following Block (1995, 2002). Block writes that “a state is [access conscious]
if it is broadcast for free use in reasoning and for direct ‘rational’ control of action (including
reporting)” (2002, p. 208). There seems to be a close connection between a mental state’s being
conscious, in our sense, and its contents being available to us to report to others or to use in making
rational choices. For example, we would expect to be able to report seeing a briefly-presented
visual stimulus if we had a conscious experience of seeing it and to be unable to report seeing

(^1) The “phenomenology” or “phenomenal character” of a conscious experience is what it is like for the subject. In our
terminology, all and only conscious experiences have phenomenal characters.


it if we did not. However, these two properties of mental states are conceptually distinct. How
phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness relate to each other is an open question.

Finally, the word “sentient” is sometimes used synonymously with (phenomenally) “conscious”,
but we prefer “conscious”. “Sentient” is sometimes used to mean having senses, such as vision or
olfaction. However, being conscious is not the same as having senses. It is possible for a system to
sense its body or environment without having any conscious experiences, and it may be possible
for a system to be conscious without sensing its body or environment. “Sentient” is also sometimes
used to mean capable of having conscious experiences such as pleasure or pain, which feel good
or bad, and we do not want to imply that conscious systems must have these capacities. A system
could be conscious in our sense even if it only had “neutral” conscious experiences. Pleasure and
pain are important but they are not our focus here.^2

### 1.2 Methods and Assumptions

Our method for investigating whether current or near-future AI systems might be conscious is
based on three assumptions. These are:

1. Computational functionalism: Implementing computations of a certain kind is nec-
    essary and sufficient for consciousness, so it is possible in principle for non-organic
    artificial systems to be conscious.
2. Scientific theories:Neuroscientific research has made progress in characterising func-
    tions that are associated with, and may be necessary or sufficient for, consciousness;
    these are described by scientific theories of consciousness.
3. Theory-heavy approach:A particularly promising method for investigating whether AI
    systems are likely to be conscious is assessing whether they meet functional or architec-
    tural conditions drawn from scientific theories, as opposed to looking for theory-neutral
    behavioural signatures.

These ideas inform our investigation in different ways. We adopt computational functionalism
as a working hypothesis because this assumption makes it relatively straightforward to draw infer-

(^2) For the sake of further illustration, here are some other definitions of phenomenal consciousness:
Chalmers (1996): “When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is also a
subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there issomething it is liketo be a conscious organism. This subjective
aspect is experience. When we see, for example, weexperiencevisual sensations: the felt quality of redness, the
experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual field. Other experiences go along with perception in
different modalities: the sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations, from pains to
orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream
of conscious thought. What unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in them.”
Graziano (2017): “You can connect a computer to a camera and program it to process visual information—color,
shape, size, and so on. The human brain does the same, but in addition, we report a subjective experience of those
visual properties. This subjective experience is not always present. A great deal of visual information enters the
eyes, is processed by the brain and even influences our behavior through priming effects, without ever arriving in
awareness. Flash something green in the corner of vision and ask people to name the first color that comes to mind,
and they may be more likely to say ‘green’ without even knowing why. But some proportion of the time we also
claim, ‘I have a subjective visual experience. Iseethat thing with my conscious mind. Seeingfeelslike something.’”


ences from neuroscientific theories of consciousness to claims about AI. Some researchers in this
area reject computational functionalism (e.g. Searle 1980, Tononi & Koch 2015) but our view is
that it is worth exploring its implications. We accept the relevance and value of some scientific
theories of consciousness because they describe functions that could be implemented in AI and
we judge that they are supported by good experimental evidence. And, our view is that, although
this may not be so in other cases, a theory-heavy approach is necessary for AI. A theory-heavy
approach is one that focuses on how systems work, rather than on whether they display forms of
outward behaviour that might be taken to be characteristic of conscious beings (Birch 2022b). We
explain these three ideas in more detail in this section.

Two further points about our methods and assumptions are worth noting before we go on. The
first is that, for convenience, we will generally write as though whether a system is conscious is
an all-or-nothing matter, and there is always a determinate fact about this (although in many cases
this fact may be difficult to learn). However, we are open to the possibility that this may not be
the case: that it may be possible for a system to be partly conscious, conscious to some degree, or
neither determinately conscious nor determinately non-conscious (see Box 1).

```
Box 1: Determinacy, degrees, dimensions
```
```
In this report, we generally write as though consciousness is an all-or-nothing matter: a
system either is conscious, or it isn’t. However, there are various other possibilities. There
seem to be many properties that have “blurry” boundaries, in the sense that whether some
object has that property may be indeterminate. For example, a shirt may be a colour some-
where on the borderline between yellow and green, such that there is no fact of the matter
about whether it is yellow or not. In principle, consciousness could be like this: there could
be creatures that are neither determinately conscious nor determinately non-conscious (Si-
mon 2017, Schwitzgebel forthcoming). If this is the case, some AI systems could be in this
“blurry” zone. This kind of indeterminacy arguably follows from materialism about con-
sciousness (Birch 2022a).
Another possibility is that there could be degrees of consciousness so that it is possible for
one system to be more conscious than another (Lee 2022). In this case, it might be possi-
ble to build AI systems that are conscious but only to a very slight degree, or even systems
which are conscious to a much greater degree than humans (Shulman & Bostrom 2021).
Alternatively, rather than a single scale, it could be that consciousness varies along multiple
dimensions (Birch et al. 2020).
Lastly, it could be that there are multiple elements of consciousness. These would not be
necessary conditions for some further property of consciousness, but rather constituents
which make up consciousness. These elements may be typically found together in humans,
but separable in other animals or AI systems. In this case, it would be possible for a system
to be partly conscious, in the sense of having some of these elements.
```
The second is that we recommend thinking about consciousness in AI in terms of confidence
or credence. Uncertainty about this topic is currently unavoidable, but there can, nonetheless, be
good reasons to think that one system is much more likely than another to be conscious, and this
can be relevant to how we should act. So it is useful to think about one’s credence in claims in this


area. For instance, one might think it justified to have a credence of about 0.5 in the conjunction of
a set of theoretical claims which imply that a given AI system is conscious; if so, one should have
a similar credence that the system is conscious.

#### 1.2.1 Computational functionalism

Computational functionalism about consciousness is a claim about the kinds of properties of sys-
tems with which consciousness is correlated. According tofunctionalismabout consciousness, it
is necessary and sufficient for a system to be conscious that it has a certain functional organisa-
tion: that is, that it can enter a certain range of states, which stand in certain causal relations to
each other and to the environment. Computational functionalism is a version of functionalism that
further claims that the relevant functional organisation is computational.^3

Systems that perform computations process information by implementing algorithms; compu-
tational functionalism claims that it is sufficient for a state to be conscious that it plays a role of the
right kind in the implementation of the right kind of algorithm. For a system to implement a partic-
ular algorithm is for it to have a set of features at a certain level of abstraction: specifically, a range
of possible information-carrying states, and particular dispositions to make transitions between
these states. The algorithm implemented by a system is an abstract specification of the transitions
between states, including inputs and outputs, which it is disposed to make. For example, a pocket
calculator implements a particular algorithm for arithmetic because it generates transitions from
key-presses to results on screen by going through particular sequences of internal states.

An important upshot of computational functionalism, then, is that whether a system is con-
scious or not depends on features that are more abstract than the lowest-level details of its physical
make-up. The material substrate of a system does not matter for consciousness except insofar as
the substrate affects which algorithms the system can implement. This means that consciousness
is, in principle, multiply realisable: it can exist in multiple substrates, not just in biological brains.
That said, computational functionalism does not entail thatanysubstrate can be used to construct
a conscious system (Block 1996). As Michel and Lau (2021) put it, “Swiss cheese cannot imple-
ment the relevant computations.” We tentatively assume that computers as we know them are in
principle capable of implementing algorithms sufficient for consciousness, but we do not claim
that this is certain.

It is also important to note that systems that compute the same mathematical function may
do so by implementing different algorithms, so computational functionalism does not imply that
systems that “do the same thing” in the sense that they compute the same input-output function are
necessarily alike in consciousness (Sprevak 2007). Furthermore, it is consistent with computational
functionalism that consciousness may depend on performing operations on states with specific
representational formats, such as analogue representation (Block 2023). In terms of Marr’s (1982)
levels of analysis, the idea is that consciousness depends on what is going on in a system at the

(^3) Computational functionalism is compatible with a range of views about the relationship between consciousness and
the physical states which implement computations. In particular, it is compatible with both (i) the view that there is
nothing more to a state’s being conscious than its playing a certain role in implementing a computation; and (ii) the
view that a state’s being conscious is a matter of its havingsui generisphenomenal properties, for which its role in
implementing a computation is sufficient.


algorithmic and representational level, as opposed to the implementation level, or the more abstract
“computational” (input-output) level.

We adopt computational functionalism as a working hypothesis primarily for pragmatic rea-
sons. The majority of leading scientific theories of consciousness can be interpreted computa-
tionally—that is, as making claims about computational features which are necessary or sufficient
for consciousness in humans. If computational functionalism is true, and if these theories are
correct, these features would also be necessary or sufficient for consciousness in AI systems. Non-
computational differences between humans and AI systems would not matter. The assumption
of computational functionalism, therefore, allows us to draw inferences from computational sci-
entific theories to claims about the likely conditions for consciousness in AI. On the other hand,
if computational functionalism is false, there is no guarantee that computational features which
are correlated with consciousness in humans will be good indicators of consciousness in AI. It
could be, for instance, that some non-computational feature of living organisms is necessary for
consciousness (Searle 1980, Seth 2021), in which case consciousness would be impossible in non-
organic artificial systems.

Having said that, it would not be worthwhile to investigate artificial consciousness on the as-
sumption of computational functionalism if this thesis were not sufficiently plausible. Although
we have different levels of confidence in computational functionalism, we agree that it is plausi-
ble.^4 These different levels of confidence feed into our personal assessments of the likelihood that
particular AI systems are conscious, and of the likelihood that conscious AI is possible at all.

#### 1.2.2 Scientific theories of consciousness

The second idea which informs our approach is that some scientific theories of consciousness are
well-supported by empirical evidence and make claims which can help us assess AI systems for
consciousness. These theories have been developed, tested and refined through decades of high-
quality neuroscientific research (for recent reviews, see Seth & Bayne 2022, Yaron et al. 2022).
Positing that computational functions are sufficient for consciousness would not get us far if we
had no idea which functions matter; but these theories give us valuable indications.

Scientific theories of consciousness are different from metaphysical theories of consciousness.
Metaphysical theories of consciousness make claims about how consciousness relates to the ma-
terial world in the most general sense. Positions in the metaphysics of consciousness include
property dualism (Chalmers 1996, 2002), panpsychism (Strawson 2006, Goff 2017), materialism
(Tye 1995, Papineau 2002) and illusionism (Frankish 2016). For example, materialism claims that
phenomenal properties are physical properties while property dualism denies this. In contrast, sci-
entific theories of consciousness make claims about which specific material phenomena—usually
brain processes—are associated with consciousness. Some explicitly aim to identify the neural cor-
relates of conscious states (NCCs), defined as the minimal sets of neural events which are jointly
sufficient for those states (Crick & Koch 1990, Chalmers 2000). The central question for scientific
theories of consciousness is what distinguishes cases in which conscious experience arises from

(^4) One influential argument is by Chalmers (1995): if a person’s neurons were gradually replaced by functionally-e-
quivalent artificial prostheses, their behaviour would stay the same, so it is implausible that they would undergo any
radical change in conscious experience (if they did, they would act as though they hadn’t noticed).


those in which it does not, and while this is not the only question such theories might address, it is
the focus of this report.

We discuss several specific scientific theories in detail in section 2. Here, we provide a brief
overview of the methods of consciousness science to show that consciousness can be studied sci-
entifically.

The scientific study of consciousness relies on assumptions about links between consciousness
and behaviour (Irvine 2013). For instance, in a study on vision, experimenters might manipulate a
visual stimulus (e.g. a red triangle) in a certain way—say, by flashing it at two different speeds. If
they find that subjects report seeing the stimulus in one condition but not in the other, they might
argue that subjects have a conscious visual experience of the stimulus in one condition but not
in the other. They could then measure differences in brain activity between the two conditions,
and draw inferences about the relationships between brain activity and consciousness—a method
called “contrastive analysis” (Baars 1988). This method relies on the assumption that subjects’
reports are a good guide to their conscious experiences.

As a method for studying consciousness in humans and other animals, relying on subjects’
reports has two main problems. The first problem is uncertainty about the relationship between
conscious experience, reports and cognitive processes which may be involved in making reports,
such as attention and memory. Inasmuch as reports or reportability require more processing than
conscious experience, studies that rely on reports may be misleading: brain processes which are
involved in processing the stimulus and making reports, but are not necessary for consciousness,
could be misidentified as among the neural correlates of consciousness (Aru et al. 2012). Another
possibility is that phenomenal consciousness may have relatively rich contents, of which only a
proportion are selected by attention for further processing yielding cognitive access, which is, in
turn, necessary for report. In this case, relying on reports may lead us to misidentify the neural basis
of access as that of phenomenal consciousness (Block 1995, 2007). The methodological problem
here is arguably more severe because it is an open question whether phenomenal consciousness
“overflows” cognitive access in this way—researchers have conflicting views (Phillips 2018a).

A partial solution to this problem may be the use of “no-report paradigms”, in which indicators
of consciousness other than reports are used, having been calibrated for correlation with conscious-
ness in separate experiments, which do use reports (Tsuchiya et al. 2015). The advantage of this
paradigm is that subjects are not required to make reports in the main experiments, which may
mitigate the problem of report confounds. No-report paradigms are not a “magic bullet” for this
problem (Block 2019, Michel & Morales 2020), but they may be an important step in addressing
it.

Another possible method for measuring consciousness is the use of metacognitive judgments
such as confidence ratings (e.g. Peters & Lau 2015). For example, subjects might be asked how
confident they are in an answer about a stimulus, e.g. about whether a briefly-presented stimulus
was oriented vertically or horizontally. The underlying thought here is that subjects’ ability to
track the accuracy of their responses using confidence ratings (known as metacognitive sensitivity)
depends on their being conscious of the relevant stimuli. Again, this method is imperfect, but it has
some advantages over asking subjects to report their conscious experiences (Morales & Lau 2021;
Michel 2022). There are various potential confounds in consciousness science, but researchers can
combine evidence from studies of different kinds to reduce the force of methodological objections


(Lau 2022).

The second problem with the report approach is that there are presumably some subjects of
conscious experience who cannot make reports, including non-human animals, infants and people
with certain kinds of cognitive disability. This problem is perhaps most pressing in the case of non-
human animals, because if we knew more about consciousness in animals—especially those which
are relatively unlike us—we might have a far better picture of the range of brain processes that are
correlated with consciousness. This difficult problem has recently received increased attention
(e.g. Birch 2022b). However, although current scientific theories of consciousness are primarily
based on data from healthy adult humans, it can still be highly instructive to examine whether AI
systems use processes similar to those described by these theories.

```
Box 2: Metaphysical theories and the science of consciousness
```
```
Major positions in the metaphysics of consciousness include materialism, property dualism,
panpsychism and illusionism (for a detailed and influential overview, see Chalmers 2002).
Materialismclaims that consciousness is a wholly physical phenomenon. Conscious ex-
periences are states of the physical world—typically brain states—and the properties that
make up the phenomenal character of our experiences, known as phenomenal properties,
are physical properties of these states. For example, a materialist might claim that the expe-
rience of seeing a red tulip is a particular brain state and that the “redness” of the experience
is a feature of that state.
Property dualismdenies materialism, claiming that phenomenal properties are non-physical
properties. Unlikesubstancedualism, this view claims that there is just one sort of substance
or entity while asserting that it has both physical and phenomenal properties. The “redness”
of the experience of seeing the tulip may be a property of the brain state involved, but it is
distinct from any physical property of this state.
Panpsychismclaims that phenomenal properties, or simpler but related “proto-phenomenal”
properties, are present in all fundamental physical entities. A panpsychist might claim that
an electron, as a fundamental particle, has either a property like the “redness” of the tulip
experience or a special precursor of this property. Panpsychists do not generally claim that
everything has conscious experiences—instead, the phenomenal aspects of fundamental en-
tities only combine to give rise to conscious experiences in a few macro-scale entities, such
as humans.
Illusionismclaims that we are subject to an illusion in our thinking about consciousness
and that either consciousness does not exist (strongillusionism), or we are pervasively mis-
taken about some of its features (weakillusionism). However, even strong illusionism ac-
knowledges the existence of “quasi-phenomenal” properties, which are properties that are
misrepresented by introspection as phenomenal. For example, an illusionist might say that
when one seems to have the conscious experience of seeing a red tulip, some brain state is
misrepresented by introspection as having a property of phenomenal “redness”.
Importantly, there is work for the science of consciousness to do on all four of these meta-
physical positions. Ifmaterialismis true, then some brain states are conscious experiences
```

```
and others are not, and the role of neuroscience is to find out what distinguishes them. Sim-
ilarly,property dualismandpanpsychismboth claim that some brain states but not others
are associated with conscious experiences, and are compatible with the claim that this differ-
ence can be investigated scientifically. According toillusionism, neuroscience can explain
why the illusion of consciousness arises, and in particular why it arises in connection with
some brain states but not others.
```
#### 1.2.3 Theory-heavy approach

In section 1.2.1 we adopted computational functionalism, the thesis that implementing certain
computational processes is necessary and sufficient for consciousness, as a working hypothesis,
and in section 1.2.2 we noted that there are scientific theories that aim to describe correlations be-
tween computational processes and consciousness. Combining these two points yields a promising
method for investigating consciousness in AI systems: we can observe whether they use compu-
tational processes which are similar to those described in scientific theories of consciousness, and
adjust our assessment accordingly. To a first approximation, our confidence that a given system is
conscious can be determined by (a) the similarity of its computational processes to those posited by
a given scientific theory of consciousness, (b) our confidence in this theory, (c) and our confidence
in computational functionalism.^5 Considering multiple theories can then give a fuller picture. This
method represents a “theory-heavy” approach to investigating consciousness in AI.

The term “theory-heavy” comes from Birch (2022b), who considers how we can scientifically
investigate consciousness in non-human animals, specifically invertebrates.

Birch argues against using the theory-heavy approach in this case. One of Birch’s objections
is that the evidence from humans that supports scientific theories does not tell us how much their
conditions can be relaxed while still being sufficient for consciousness (see also Carruthers 2019).
That is, while we might have good evidence that some process is sufficient for consciousness in
humans, this evidence will not tell us whether a process in another animal, which is similar in
some respects but not others, is also sufficient for consciousness. To establish this we would need
antecedent evidence about which non-human animals or systems are conscious—unfortunately,
the very question we are uncertain about.

Another way of thinking about this problem is in terms of how we shouldinterprettheories of
consciousness. As we will see throughout this report, it is possible to interpret theories either in
relatively restrictive ways, as claiming only that very specific features found in humans are suf-
ficient for consciousness, or as giving much more liberal, abstract conditions, which may be met
by surprisingly simple artificial systems (Shevlin 2021). Moderate interpretations which strike a
balance between appealing generality (consciousness is not justthisvery specific process in the hu-
man brain) and unintuitive liberality (consciousness is not a property satisfied by extremely simple
systems) are attractive, but it is not clear that these have empirical support over the alternatives.

(^5) The theory may entail computational functionalism, in which case (c) would be unnecessary. But we find it helpful
to emphasise that if computational functionalism is a background assumption in one’s construal of a theory, one
should take into account both uncertainty about this assumption, and uncertainty about the specifics of the theory.


While this objection does point to an important limitation of theory-heavy approaches, it does
not show that a theory-heavy approach cannot give us useful information about consciousness in
AI. Some AI systems will use processes that are much more similar to those identified by theo-
ries of consciousness than others, and this objection does not count against the claim that those
using more similar processes are correspondingly better candidates for consciousness. Drawing
on theories of consciousness is necessary for our investigation because they are the best available
guide to the features we should look for. Investigating animal consciousness is different because
we already have reasons to believe that animals that are more closely related to humans and dis-
play more complex behaviours are better candidates for consciousness. Similarities in cognitive
architecture can be expected to be substantially correlated with phylogenetic relatedness, so while
it will be somewhat informative to look for these similarities, this will be less informative than in
the case of AI.^6

The main alternative to the theory-heavy approach for AI is to use behavioural tests that pur-
port to be neutral between scientific theories. Behavioural tests have been proposed specifically
for consciousness in AI (Elamrani & Yampolskiy 2019). One interesting example is Schnei-
der’s (2019) Artificial Consciousness Test, which requires the AI system to show a ready grasp
of consciousness-related concepts and ideas in conversation, perhaps exhibiting “problem intu-
itions” like the judgement that spectrum inversion is possible (Chalmers 2018). The Turing test
has also been proposed as a test for consciousness (Harnad 2003).

In general, we are sceptical about whether behavioural approaches to consciousness in AI can
avoid the problem that AI systems may be trained to mimic human behaviour while working in very
different ways, thus “gaming” behavioural tests (Andrews & Birch 2023). Large language model-
based conversational agents, such as ChatGPT, produce outputs that are remarkably human-like
in some ways but are arguably very unlike humans in the way they work. They exemplify both
the possibility of cases of this kind and the fact that companies are incentivised to build systems
that can mimic humans.^7 Schneider (2019) proposes to avoid gaming by restricting the access of
systems to be tested to human literature on consciousness so that they cannot learn to mimic the
way we talk about this subject. However, it is not clear either whether this measure would be
sufficient, or whether it is possible to give the system enough access to data that it can engage with
the test, without giving it so much as to enable gaming (Udell & Schwitzgebel 2021).

(^6) Birch (2022b) advocates a “theory-light” approach, which has two aspects: (1) rejecting the idea that we should as-
sess consciousness in non-human animals by looking for processes that particular theories associate with conscious-
ness; and (2) not committing to any particular theory now, but aiming to develop better theories in the future when
we have more evidence about animal (and perhaps AI) consciousness. Our approach is “theory-heavy” in the sense
that, in contrast with the first aspect of the theory-light approach, we do assess AI systems by looking for processes
that scientific theories associate with consciousness. However, like Birch, we do not commit to any one theory at
this time. More generally, Birch’s approach makes recommendations about how the science of consciousness should
be developed, whereas we are only concerned with what kind of evidence should be used to make assessments of
consciousness in AI systems now, given our current knowledge.
(^7) See section 4.1.2 for discussion of the risk that there may soon be many non-conscious AI systems that seem con-
scious to users.


## 2 Scientific Theories of Consciousness

In this section, we survey a selection of scientific theories of consciousness, scientific proposals
which are not exactly theories of consciousness but which bear on our project, and other claims
from scientists and philosophers about putatively necessary conditions for consciousness. From
these theories and proposals, we aim to extract a list of indicators of consciousness that can be
applied to particular AI systems to assess how likely it is that they are conscious.^8 Because we
are looking for indicators that are relevant to AI, we discuss possible artificial implementations of
theories and conditions for consciousness at points in this section. However, we address this topic
in more detail in section 3, which is about what it takes for AI systems to have the features that we
identify as indicators of consciousness.

Sections 2.1-2.3 cover recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory and higher-order
theories of consciousness—with a particular focus in 2.3 on perceptual reality monitoring theory.
These are established scientific theories of consciousness that are compatible with our computa-
tional functionalist framework. Section 2.4 discusses several other scientific theories, along with
other proposed conditions for consciousness, and section 2.5 gives our list of indicators.

We do not aim to adjudicate between the theories which we consider in this section, although
we do indicate some of their strengths and weaknesses. We do not adopt any one theory, claim that
any particular condition is definitively necessary for consciousness, or claim that any combination
of conditions is jointly sufficient. This is why we describe the list we offer in section 2.5 as a list
ofindicatorsof consciousness, rather than a list of conditions. The features in the list are there
because theories or theorists claim that they are necessary or sufficient, but our claim is merely
that it iscrediblethat they are necessary or (in combination) sufficient because this is implied by
credible theories. Their presence in a system makes it more probable that the system is conscious.
We claim that assessing whether a system has these features is the best way to judge whether it is
likely to be conscious given the current state of scientific knowledge of the subject.

### 2.1 Recurrent Processing Theory

#### 2.1.1 Introduction to recurrent processing theory

The recurrent processing theory (RPT; Lamme 2006, 2010, 2020) is a prominent member of a
group of neuroscientific theories of consciousness that focus on processing in perceptual areas in
the brain (for others, see Zeki & Bartels 1998, Malach 2021). These are sometimes referred to
as “local” (as opposed to “global”) theories of consciousness because they claim that activity of
the right form in relatively circumscribed brain regions is sufficient for consciousness, perhaps
provided that certain background conditions are met. RPT is primarily a theory of visual con-
sciousness: it seeks to explain what distinguishes states in which stimuli are consciously seen from
those in which they are merely unconsciously represented by visual system activity. The theory

(^8) A similar approach to the question of AI consciousness is found in Chalmers (2023) which considers several features
of LLMs which give us reason to think they are conscious, and several commonly-expressed “defeaters” for LLM
consciousness. Many of these considerations are, like our indicators, drawn from scientific theories of consciousness.


claims that unconscious vs. conscious states correspond to distinct stages in visual processing. An
initial feedforward sweep of activity through the hierarchy of visual areas is sufficient for some
visual operations like extracting features from the scene, but not sufficient for conscious experi-
ence. When the stimulus is sufficiently strong or salient, however, recurrent processing occurs, in
which signals are sent back from higher areas in the visual hierarchy to lower ones. This recur-
rent processing generates a conscious representation of an organised scene, which is influenced
by perceptual inference—processing in which some features of the scene or percept are inferred
from other features. On this view, conscious visual experience does not require the involvement
of non-visual areas like the prefrontal cortex, or attention—in contrast with “global” theories like
global workspace theory and higher-order theories, which we will consider shortly.

#### 2.1.2 Evidence for recurrent processing theory

The evidence for RPT is of two kinds: the first is evidence that recurrent processing is necessary
for conscious vision, and the second is evidence against rival theories which claim that additional
processing for functions beyond perceptual organisation is required.

Evidence of the first kind comes from experiments involving backward masking and transcra-
nial magnetic stimulation, which indicate that feedforward activity in the primary visual cortex
(the first stage of processing mentioned above) is not sufficient for consciousness (Lamme 2006).
Lamme also argues that, although feedforward processing is sufficient for basic visual functions
like categorising features, important functions like feature grouping and binding and figure-ground
segregation require recurrence. He, therefore, claims that recurrent processing is necessary for the
generation of an organised, integrated visual scene—the kind of scene that we seem to encounter
in conscious vision (Lamme 2010, 2020).

Evidence against more demanding rival theories includes results from lesion and brain stim-
ulation studies suggesting that additional processing in the prefrontal cortex is not necessary for
conscious visual perception. This counts against non-“local” views insofar as they claim that func-
tions in the prefrontal cortex are necessary for consciousness (Malach 2022; for a countervailing
analysis see Michel 2022). Proponents of RPT also argue that the evidence used to support rival
views is confounded by experimental requirements for downstream cognitive processes associated
with making reports. The idea is that when participants produce the reports (and other behavioural
responses) that are used to indicate conscious perception, this requires cognitive processes that
are not themselves necessary for consciousness. So where rival theories claim that downstream
processes are necessary for consciousness, advocates of RPT and similar theories respond that the
relevant evidence is explained by confounding factors (see the methodological issues discussed in
section 1.2.2).


#### 2.1.3 Indicators from recurrent processing theory

There are various possible interpretations of RPT that have different implications for AI conscious-
ness. For our purposes, a crucial issue is that the claim that recurrent processing is necessary for

```
Figure 1: An unfolded recurrent neural networkas de-
picted in LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton (2015). Attribution-
Share Alike 4.0 International.
```
consciousness can be interpreted in
two different ways. In the brain, it
is common for individual neurons to
receive inputs that are influenced by
their own earlier outputs, as a result
of feedback loops from connected re-
gions. However, a form of recur-
rence can be achieved without this
structure: any finite sequence of op-
erations by a network with feedback
loops can be mimicked by a suitable
feedforward network with enough
layers. To achieve this, the feedfor-
ward network would have multiple
layers with shared weights, so that the same operations would be performed repeatedly—thus mim-
icking the effect of repeated processing of information by a single set of neurons, which would be
produced by a network with feedback loops (Savage 1972, LeCun et al. 2015). In current AI,
recurrent neural networks are implemented indistinguishably from deep feedforward networks in
which layers share weights, with different groups of input nodes for successive inputs feeding into
the network at successive layers.

We will say that networks with feedback loops such as those in the brain, which allow in-
dividual physically-realised neurons to process information repeatedly, displayimplementational
recurrence. However, deep feedforward networks with weight-sharing display onlyalgorithmic
recurrence—they are algorithmically similar to implementationally recurrent networks but have a
different underlying structure. So there are two possible interpretations of RPT available here: it
could be interpreted either as claiming that consciousness requires implementational recurrence,
or as making only the weaker claim that algorithmic recurrence is required. Doerig et al. (2019)
interpret RPT as claiming that implementational recurrence is required for consciousness and crit-
icise it for this claim. However, in personal communication, Lamme has suggested to us that RPT
can also be given the weaker algorithmic interpretation.

Implementational and algorithmic recurrence are both possible indicators of consciousness in
AI, but we focus on algorithmic recurrence. It is possible to build an artificial system that displays
implementational recurrence, but this would involve ensuring that individual neurons were phys-
ically realised by specific components in the hardware. This would be a very different approach
from standard methods in current AI, in which neural networks are simulated without using specific
hardware components to realise each component of the network. An implementational recurrence
indicator would therefore be less relevant to our project, so we do not adopt this indicator.

Using algorithmic recurrence, in contrast, is a weak condition that many AI systems already
meet. However, it is non-trivial, and we argue below that there are other reasons, besides the


evidence for RPT, to believe that algorithmic recurrence is necessary for consciousness. So we
adopt this as our first indicator:

```
RPT-1: Input modules using algorithmic recurrence
```
This is an important indicator because systems that lack this feature are significantly worse
candidates for consciousness.

RPT also suggests a second indicator, because it may be interpreted as claiming that it is suffi-
cient for consciousness that algorithmic recurrence is used to generate integrated perceptual repre-
sentations of organised, coherent scenes, with figure-ground segregation and the representation of
objects in spatial relations. This second indicator is:

```
RPT-2: Input modules generating organised, integrated perceptual representations
```
An important contrast for RPT is between the functions of feature extraction and perceptual
organisation. Features in visual scenes can be extracted in unconscious processing in humans,
but operations of perceptual organisation such as figure-ground segregation may require conscious
vision; this is why RPT-2 stresses organised, integrated perceptual representations.

There are also two further possible interpretations of RPT, which we set aside for different
reasons. First, according to the biological interpretation of RPT, recurrent processing in the brain
is necessary and sufficient for consciousness because it is associated with certain specific biological
phenomena, such as recruiting particular kinds of neurotransmitters and receptors which facilitate
synaptic plasticity. This biological interpretation is suggested by some of Lamme’s arguments (and
was suggested to us by Lamme in personal communication): Lamme (2010) argues that there could
be a “fundamental neural difference” between feedforward and recurrent processing in the brain
and that we should expect consciousness to be associated with a “basic neural mechanism”. We set
this interpretation aside because if some particular, biologically-characterised neural mechanism is
necessary for consciousness, artificial systems cannot be conscious.

Second, RPT may be understood as a theory only of visual consciousness, which makes no
commitments about what is necessary or sufficient for consciousness more generally. On this
interpretation, RPT would leave open both: (i) whether non-visual conscious experiences require
similar processes to visual ones, and (ii) whether some further background conditions, typically
met in humans but not specified by the theory, must be met even for visual consciousness. This
interpretation of the theory is reasonable given that the theory has not been extended beyond vision
and that it is doubtful whether activity in visual brain areas sustainedin vitrowould be sufficient for
consciousness (Block 2005). But on this interpretation, RPT would have very limited implications
for AI.

### 2.2 Global Workspace Theory

#### 2.2.1 Introduction to global workspace theory

The global workspace theory of consciousness (GWT) is founded on the idea that humans and
other animals use many specialised systems, often called modules, to perform cognitive tasks


of particular kinds. These specialised systems can perform tasks efficiently, independently and
in parallel. However, they are also integrated to form a single system by features of the mind
which allow them to share information. This integration makes it possible for modules to operate
together in co-ordinated and flexible ways, enhancing the capabilities of the system as a whole.
GWT claims that one way in which modules are integrated is by their common access to a “global
workspace”—a further “space” in the system where information can be represented. Information
represented in the global workspace can influence activity in any of the modules. The workspace
has a limited capacity, so an ongoing process of competition and selection is needed to determine
what is represented there.

GWT claims that what it is for a state to be conscious is for it to be a representation in the
global workspace. Another way to express this claim is that states are conscious when they are
“globally broadcast” to many modules, through the workspace. GWT was introduced by Baars
(1988) and has been elaborated and defended by Dehaene and colleagues, who have developed
a neural version of the theory (Dehaene et al. 1998, 2003, Dehaene & Naccache 2001, Dehaene
& Changeux 2011, Mashour et al. 2020). Proponents of GWT argue that the global workspace
explains why some privileged subset of perceptual (and other) representations are available at
any given time for functions such as reasoning, decision-making and storage in episodic memory.
Perceptual representations get stronger due to the strength of the stimulus or are amplified by
attention because they are relevant to ongoing tasks; as a result, these representations “win the
contest” for entry to the global workspace. This allows them to influence processing in modules
other than those that produced them.

The neural version of GWT claims there is a widely distributed network of “workspace neu-
rons”, originating in frontoparietal areas, with activity in this network, which is sustained by recur-
rent processing, constituting conscious representations. When perceptual representations become
sufficiently strong, a process called “ignition” takes place in which activity in the workspace neu-
rons comes to code for their content. Ignition is a step-function, so whether a given representation
is broadcast, and, therefore, conscious, is not a matter of degree.

GWT is typically presented as a theory of access consciousness—that is, of the phenomenon
that some information represented in the brain, but not all, is available for rational decision-making.
However, it can also be interpreted as a theory of phenomenal consciousness, motivated by the
thought that access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness may coincide, or even be the
same property, despite being conceptually distinct (Carruthers 2019). Since our topic is phenom-
enal consciousness, we interpret the theory in this way. It is notable that although GWT does
not explicitly require agency, it can only explain access consciousness if the system is a rational
agent since access consciousness is defined as availability for rational control of action (we discuss

#### 2.2.2 Evidence for global workspace theory

There is extensive evidence for global workspace theory, drawn from many studies, of which we
can mention only a few representative examples (see Dehaene 2014 and Mashour et al. 2020
for reviews). These studies generally employ the method of contrastive analysis, in which brain
activity is measured and a comparison is made between conscious and unconscious conditions,
with efforts made to control for other differences. Various stimuli and tasks are used to generate
the conscious and unconscious conditions, and activity is measured using fMRI, MEG, EEG, or
single-cell recordings. According to GWT advocates, these studies show that conscious perception
is associated with reverberant activity in widespread networks which include the prefrontal cortex
(PFC)—this claim contrasts with the “local” character of RPT discussed above—whereas uncon-
scious states involve more limited activity confined to particular areas. This widespread activity
seems to arise late in perceptual processing, around 250-300ms after stimulus onset, supporting the
claim that global broadcast requires sustained perceptual representations (Mashour et al. 2020).


Examples of recording studies in monkeys that support a role for PFC in consciousness include
experiments by Panagiotaropoulos et al. (2012) and van Vugt et al. (2018). In the former study,
researchers were able to decode the presumed content of conscious experience during binocular
rivalry from activity in PFC (Panagiotaropoulos et al. 2012). In this study the monkeys viewed
stimuli passively—in contrast with many studies supporting GWT—so the results are not con-
founded by behavioural requirements (this was a no-report paradigm; see sections 1.2.2 and 2.1.2).
In the latter, activity was recorded from the visual areas V1 and V4 and dorsolateral PFC, while
monkeys performed a task requiring them to respond to weak visual stimuli with eye movements.
The monkeys were trained to move their gaze to a default location if they did not see the stimulus
and to a different location if they did. Seen stimuli were associated with stronger activity in V1
and V4 and late, substantial activity in PFC. Importantly, while early visual activity registered the
objective presence of the stimulus irrespective of the animal’s response, PFC activity seemed to
encode the conscious percept, as this activity was also present in false alarms—cases in which
monkeys acted as though they had seen a stimulus even though no stimulus was present. Activity
associated with unseen stimuli tended to be lost in transmission from V1 through V4, to PFC.
Studies on humans using different measurement techniques have similarly found that conscious
experience is associated with ignition-like activity patterns and decodability from PFC (e.g. Salti
et al. 2015).

#### 2.2.3 Indicators from global workspace theory

We want to identify the conditions which must be met for a system to be conscious, according
to GWT, because these conditions will be indicators of consciousness in artificial systems. This
means that a crucial issue is exactly what it takes for a system to implement a global workspace.
Several authors have noted that it is not obvious how similar a system must be to the human
mind, in respect of its workspace-like features, to have the kind of global workspace that is suf-
ficient, in context, for consciousness (Bayne 2010, Carruthers 2019, Birch 2022b, Seth & Bayne
2022). There are perhaps four aspects to this problem. First, workspace-like architectures could be
used with a variety of different combinations of modules with different capabilities; as Carruthers
(2019) points out, humans have a rich and specific set of capabilities that seem to be facilitated
by the workspace and may not be shared with other systems. So one question is whether some
specific set of modules accessing the workspace is required for workspace activity to be con-
scious. Second, it’s unclear what degree of similarity a process must bear to selection, ignition and
broadcasting in the human brain to support consciousness. Third, it is difficult to know what to
make of possible systems which use workspace-like mechanisms but in which there are multiple
workspaces—perhaps integrating overlapping sets of modules—or in which the workspaces are
not global, in the sense that they do not integrate all modules. And fourth, there are arguably two
stages involved in global broadcast—selection for representation in the workspace, and uptake by
consumer modules—in which case there is a question about which of these makes particular states
conscious.

Although these questions are difficult, it is possible that empirical evidence could be brought to
bear on them. For example, studies on non-human animals could help to identify a natural kind that
includes the human global workspace and facilitates consciousness-linked abilities (Birch 2020).
Reflection on AI can also be useful here because we can recognise functional similarities and dis-


similarities between actual or possible systems and the hypothesised global workspace, separately
from the range of modules in the system or the details of neurobiological implementation, and thus
develop a clearer sense of the possible functional kinds in this area.

Advocates of GWT have argued that the global workspace facilitates a range of functions in
humans and other animals (Baars 1988, Shanahan 2010). These include making it possible for
modules to exert ongoing control over others for the duration of a task (e.g. in the case of searching
for a face in a crowd), and dealing with novel stimuli by broadcasting information about them,
thus putting the system in a position to learn the most effective response. Global broadcast and
the capacity to sustain a representation over time, while using it to process incoming stimuli,
are necessary for these functions. Because the global workspace requires that information from
different modules is represented in a common “language”, it also makes it possible to learn and
generate crossmodal analogies (VanRullen & Kanai 2021, Goyal et al. 2022). A particularly
sophisticated and notable possible function of the global workspace is “System 2 thought”, which
involves executing strategies for complex tasks in which the workspace facilitates extended and
controlled interactions between modules (Kahneman 2011, VanRullen & Kanai 2021, Goyal &
Bengio 2022). For example, planning a dinner party may involve engaging in an extended process,
controlled by this objective, of investigative actions (looking to see what is in the fridge), calls to
episodic memory, imagination in various modalities (how the food will taste, how difficult it will
be to cook, how the guests will interact), evaluation and decision-making. In this case, according
to the theory, the workspace would maintain a representation of the goal, and perhaps compressed
summaries of interim conclusions, and would pass queries and responses between modules.

We argue that GWT can be expressed in four conditions of progressively increasing strength.
Systems that meet more of these conditions possess more aspects of the full global workspace
architecture and are, therefore, better candidates for consciousness.

The first condition is possessing specialised systems which can perform tasks in parallel. We
call these systems “modules”, but they need not be modules in the demanding sense set out by
Fodor (1983); they need not be informationally encapsulated or use dedicated components of the
architecture with functions assigned prior to training. Mashour et al.’s recent statement of the
global neuronal workspace hypothesis claims only that modules in which unconscious process-
ing takes place are localised and specialised, and that they process “specific perceptual, motor,
memory and evaluative information” (2020, p. 777). It may be that having more independent
and differentiated modules makes a system a better candidate for consciousness, but GWT is most
plausibly interpreted as claiming that what matters for consciousness is the process that integrates
the modules, rather than their exact characteristics. The first indicator we draw from this theory is,
therefore:

```
GWT-1: Multiple specialised systems capable of operating in parallel (modules)
```
Building on this, a core condition of GWT is the existence of a bottleneck in information flow
through the system: the capacity of the workspace must be smaller than the collective capacity of
the modules which feed into it. Having a limited capacity workspace enables modules to share
information efficiently, in contrast to schemes involving pairwise interactions such as Transform-
ers, which become expensive with scale (Goyal et al. 2022, Jaegle et al. 2021a). The bottleneck
also forces the system to learn useful, low-dimensional, multimodal representations (Bengio 2017,


Goyal & Bengio 2022). With the bottleneck comes a requirement for an attention mechanism that
selects information from the modules for representation in the workspace. This yields our second
indicator:

GWT-2: Limited capacity workspace, entailing a bottleneck in information flow and a
selective attention mechanism
A further core condition is that information in the workspace is globally broadcast, meaning
that it is available to all modules. The two conditions we have seen so far are not enough to
ensure that ongoing interaction between modules is possible, or that information in the workspace
is available to multiple output modules which can use it for different tasks. Our third indicator is,
therefore:

```
GWT-3: Global broadcast: availability of information in the workspace to all modules
```
This entails that all modules must be able to take inputs from the global workspace, includ-
ing those modules which process inputs to the system as a whole. The first two conditions can
be satisfied by wholly feedforward systems which have multiple input modules, feeding into a
limited-capacity workspace, from which information then flows on to one or more output mod-
ules. But this new condition entails that information must also flow back from the workspace to
the input modules, influencing their processing. In turn, this means that the input modules must be
(algorithmically) recurrent—and thus provides further justification for indicator RPT-1—although
output modules, which map workspace states to behaviour, need not be recurrent.

Finally, for the workspace to facilitate ongoing, controlled interactions between modules it
must have one further feature. This is that the selection mechanism that determines information
uptake from the modules must be sensitive to the state of the system, as well as to new inputs. That
is, the system must implement a form of “top-down attention” as well as “bottom-up attention”.
This allows representations in the workspace itself or in other modules to affect which information
is selected from each module. State-dependent selection can be readily implemented by systems
that meet GWT-3 because global broadcast entails that information flows from the workspace to the
modules. Generating controlled, functional interactions between modules, however, will require
that the system as a whole is suitably trained. Our fourth indicator is:

```
GWT-4: State-dependent attention, giving rise to the capacity to use the workspace to
query modules in succession to perform complex tasks
```
Compared to other scientific theories of consciousness, many more proposals have been made
for the implementation of GWT in artificial systems (e.g. Franklin & Graesser 1999, Shanahan
2006, Bao et al. 2020). We discuss implementations of GWT, together with other theories, in
section 3.1.


Box 3: Attention in neuroscience and in AI

The fields of neuroscience and machine learning each have their own distinct concepts of
attention (Lindsay 2020). In machine learning, several different forms of attention have been
developed, but at present, the most common is “self-attention” (Vaswani et al. 2023). This
is the mechanism at the heart of Transformer networks, which power large language models.

In self-attention, representations of elements of an
input sequence (for example, words in a sentence)
are allowed to interact multiplicatively. Specifically,
eachword representation, that is given as a vector
is transformed into three new vectors: a query, key,
and value. The query vector of one word is multiplied
by the key vectors of all other words to determine a
weighting for each of these words. This weighting
is applied to the value vectors of these words; the
sum of these weighted value vectors forms the new
representationof the word. This process is done in
parallel for all words.
“Cross-attention” follows a similar formula but al-
lows the query to be generated from one set of rep-
resentations and the key and values to come from
another (self-attention and cross-attention are both
forms of “key-query attention”). This can be help-
ful, for example, in translation networks that use the
words of the sentence being generated in the target language to guide attention toward the
appropriate words of the sentence in the original language.

Key-query attention has only loose connections to how attention is conceptualised in neu-
roscience. Similar to self-attention, gain modulation (wherein attention multiplicatively
scales neural activity) has been found in many neural systems (Treue & Trujillo 1999,
Reynolds & Heeger 2009). However, this attentional modulation is frequently thought to
arise from recurrent top-down connections, not from the parallel processing of concurrent
inputs (Noudoost et al. 2010, Bichot et al. 2015). Previous versions of attention in machine
learning have relied on recurrent processing, and in this way could be considered more sim-
ilar to biological attention (Mnih et al. 2014, Bahdanau et al. 2014). However, it should be
noted that there are many different flavors of attention within neuroscience and the underly-
ing neural mechanisms may vary across them. Therefore, saying definitively which forms
of artificial attention are closest to biological attention in general, is not straightforward.

Insofar as different theories of consciousness depend on recurrent processing or other spe-
cific components of the attention mechanism, self-attention may not be sufficient to form
the basis of artificial consciousness. For example, there is nothing akin to the binary igni-
tion process in global workspace theory in self-attention, as attention is implemented as a
graded weighting of inputs. There is also no built-in model of the attention process on top
of attention itself, as required in attention schema theory.


### 2.3 Higher-Order Theories

#### 2.3.1 Introduction to higher-order theories

The core claim of higher-order theories of consciousness is helpfully distilled by Brown et al.
(2019):

```
The basic idea... is that conscious experiences entail some kind of min-
imal inner awareness of one’s ongoing mental functioning, and this is due
to the first-order state being in some ways monitored or meta-represented
by a relevant higher-order representation. (p. 755)
```
Higher-order theories are distinguished from others by the emphasis that they place on the idea
that for a mental state to be conscious the subject must be aware of being in that mental state, and
the way in which they propose to account for this awareness. This is accounted for by an appeal to
higher-order representation, a concept with a very specific meaning. Higher-order representations
are ones that represent something aboutother representations, whereas first-order representations
are ones that represent something about the (non-representational) world. This distinction can be
applied to mental states. For example, a visual representation of a red apple is a first-order mental
state, and a belief that one has a representation of a red apple is a higher-order mental state.

Higher-order theories have long been advocated by philosophers (Carruthers & Gennaro 2020,
Rosenthal 2005). One of the main motivations for the view is the so-called “simple argument”
(Lycan 2001): if a mental state is conscious, the subject is aware that they are in that state; being
aware of something involves representing it; so consciousness requires higher-order representation
of one’s own mental states. The substantive commitment of this argument is that there is a single
sense of “awareness” of mental states on which both premises are true—which is both weak enough
that consciousness entails awareness of mental states, and strong enough that this awareness entails
higher-order representation. In the last two decades, higher-order theories have been elaborated,
refined and tested by neuroscientists, and influenced by new experimental methods and ideas from
the study of metacognition, signal detection theory, and the theory of predictive processing.

A variety of higher-order theories have been proposed, which describe distinct forms of mon-
itoring or meta-representation, and imply different conditions for consciousness (Brown et al.
2019). They include: several philosophical theories, including higher-order thought theory (Rosen-
thal 2005) and higher-order representation of a representation theory (Brown 2015); the self-
organising meta-representational account (Cleeremans et al. 2020); higher-order state space theory
(Fleming 2020); and perceptual reality monitoring theory (Lau 2019, 2022, Michel forthcoming).
We will concentrate on perceptual reality monitoring theory (PRM) and to some degree also the
closely-related higher-order state space theory (HOSS). These are both recent computational theo-
ries based on extensive assessments of neuroscientific evidence.

The core claim of PRM is that consciousness depends on a mechanism for distinguishing mean-
ingful activity in perceptual systems from noise. There are multiple possible sources of neural
activity in perceptual systems. This activity could be caused by perceptible stimuli in the envi-
ronment; it could be sustained after these stimuli have passed; it could be generated top-down


through expectations, imagination, dreaming or episodic memory; or it could be due to random
noise. PRM claims that a “reality monitoring” mechanism, which operates automatically, is used
to discriminate between these different kinds of activity and assess the reliability of first-order rep-
resentations. Perceptual representations are conscious when they are identified as reliable, or in
other words, as being sufficiently different from noise.

Meanwhile, HOSS makes the similar claim that “awareness is a higher-order state in a gener-
ative model of perceptual contents” (Fleming 2020, p. 2). This higher-order state, which is the
product of a metacognitive inference, signals the probability that some particular content is rep-
resented in the perceptual system. This is presented as a theory of the basis of awareness reports
(i.e. reports of the form “I am/not aware of X”), but Fleming suggests that higher-order awareness
states are necessary for consciousness.

#### 2.3.2 Computational HOTs and GWT

Computational higher-order theories are sometimes grouped together with GWT as “global” the-
ories, in opposition to “local” theories such as RPT (Michel & Doerig 2022). Like GWT, higher-
order theories such as PRM claim that cognitive functions supported by the prefrontal cortex play
an important role in consciousness. As such, the evidence reviewed above in favour of the in-
volvement of the PFC in consciousness supports PRM as well as GWT. PRM also claims, again
like GWT, that “consciousness is thegating mechanismby which perception impacts cognition; it
selects what perceptual information should directly influence our rational thinking” (Lau 2022, p.
159). Lau (2022) endorses the existence of global broadcast as a phenomenon in the brain, and also
affirms that it isrelatedto consciousness: when representations are conscious, “global broadcast
and access” of that representation “arelikelyto happen” (p. 159).

However, higher-order theorists reject the claim that broadcast in the global workspace is nec-
essary and sufficient for consciousness. Notably, according to higher-order theories, unconscious
representations can be encoded in the global workspace, which implies that a representation might
be unconscious and yet available for high-level cognitive processes, such as reasoning. Higher-
order theories and GWT make distinct predictions, and advocates of computational HOTs appeal
to experiments testing these predictions as providing important evidence in favour of their view.

In one such experiment, Lau and Passingham (2006) conducted a visual discrimination task
under a range of different masking conditions and asked participants to press a key to indicate
whether they had seen or merely guessed the shape of the stimulus in each trial. They identified
two different masking conditions in which participants’ ability to discriminate between stimuli
was at the same level, but differed in how likely they were to report having seen the stimulus.
Higher-order theorists interpret this result as showing that there can be a difference in conscious
perception of a stimulus without a corresponding difference in task performance, and claim that
this result is inconsistent with a prediction of GWT (Lau & Rosenthal 2011). This purported pre-
diction of GWT is that differences in consciousness should entail differences in task performance,
because—according to GWT—consciousness makes information available to a wide range of cog-
nitive functions, useful across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, according to GWT, ignition
leading to global broadcast is necessary and sufficient for consciousness, and ignition depends on
the same factors which affect visual task performance, such as signal strength and attention.


The broader argument here is that evidence for GWT is confounded by differences in perfor-
mance between conscious and unconscious conditions (Morales et al. 2022). Ignition leading
to global broadcast is correlated with better performance on many tasks, and in the absence of
controls, better performance is also correlated with consciousness. But since experiments seem
to show that performance and consciousness are dissociable, it is possible that ignition is neither
necessary nor sufficient for consciousness (Fleming 2020, Lau 2022).

#### 2.3.3 Indicators from computational HOTs

As we have seen, PRM claims that perceptual states are conscious when they are identified as
reliable by a metacognitive monitoring mechanism. This mechanism outputs higher-order repre-
sentations which label first-order states as accurate representations of reality. Similarly, HOSS
claims that consciousness depends on higher-order awareness states directed at perceptual repre-
sentations. Therefore, these two theories both suggest that metacognitive monitoring of perceptual
systems with relevant properties is necessary for consciousness in AI.

```
We propose two indicators based on this claim:
```
```
HOT-1: Generative, top-down or noisy perception modules
```
HOT-2: Metacognitive monitoring distinguishing reliable perceptual representations
from noise
HOT-1 is an indicator of consciousness because, according to computational HOTs, the func-
tion of the monitoring mechanisms which are responsible for consciousness is to discriminate
between different sources of activity in perceptual systems. This means that consciousness is more
likely in systems in which there are multiple possible sources of such activity. Examples of such
systems include ones in which perceptual representations can be produced top-down in imagi-
nation, as well as ones affected by random noise. HOT-2 is a statement of the main necessary
condition for consciousness according to computational HOTs.

Lau (2022) suggests that generative adversarial networks (GANs) may possess these two in-
dicators, a possibility which we discuss further in section 3.1.3. However, PRM advocates claim
that current AI systems do not meet the conditions of their theory (Michel & Lau 2021, Lau 2022).
They emphasise that perceptual reality monitoring systems must have a further feature: in addi-
tion to discriminating between perceptual states, a perceptual reality monitoring mechanism must
output to a system for “general belief-formation and rational decision-making” (Michel & Lau
2021). This condition is justified on the grounds that conscious experience has a certain “asser-
toric force”. Some of our conscious perceptual experiences present themselves to us as accurate
impressions of the outside world, and it is difficult for us to resist believing that things are as these
experiences represent them.^9 Even if we believe that we are subject to an illusion, an impres-
sion that our conscious experience is representing the world as it is remains—knowing about the

(^9) Imaginative experiences are an exception, but PRM can claim that they are classified differently by the reality
monitoring mechanism, and, therefore, have a different phenomenal character. Alternatively, higher-order theories
like HOSS and PRM can hold that imaginative experiences have some minimal amount of assertoric force, thus
explaining results in which participants are more likely to report a target as visible if it is congruent with their mental
imagery (Dijkstra et al. 2021, 2022; Dijkstra & Fleming 2023).


Muller-Lyer illusion does not prevent the two lines from looking unequal. Such experiences are ̈
persistent inputs to cognition, which are not under direct cognitive control.

Another aspect of this idea is that what makes it the case that the monitoring mechanism labels
some perceptual contents as “real” is that the person or system as a whole tends to take them
to be real when they are so labelled. This entails that the system which includes the monitoring
mechanism must be an agent which relies on perceptual representations tagged as “real” when
selecting actions. The function of the reality monitoring mechanism, then, is to identify which
perceptual states are accurate enough to be relied on in this way. Advocates of PRM propose that
to rely on perceptual content is a matter of believing that content—given their picture of belief, this
implies a system for reasoning and action selection with a holistic character, in which any belief
can in principle be called on in examining any other or in reasoning about what to do. These claims
give us our third indicator arising from HOTs:

```
HOT-3: Agency guided by a general belief-formation and action selection system, and
a strong disposition to update beliefs in accordance with the outputs of metacognitive
monitoring
```
Computational HOTs also make a further claim which yields a fourth indicator. Like most
scientific theories of consciousness, PRM aims to answer the question “what makes a state con-
scious, rather than unconscious?” However, it also attempts to answer the further question “why
do conscious mental states feel the way they do?” Its answer to this second question appeals to
quality space theory, a view that claims that phenomenal qualities can be reduced to the discrim-
inations they allow for the system (Clark 2000, Rosenthal 2010, Lau et al. 2022). For instance,
two features feel the same in virtue of the fact that, from the perspective of the system, they are
indiscriminable (Rosenthal 2010). According to this proposal, the subjective similarity of two ex-
periences is the inverse of their discriminability, and the experience of subjective qualities depends
on implicit knowledge of the similarity space. As such, quality space theory provides a functional
account of qualities (see Lau et al. 2022). For example, to have a conscious experience of the red
colour of a tulip one must have an implicit grasp of its similarity to the colour of a red apple and its
discriminability from the green of a new leaf. One hypothesis is that this implicit knowledge de-
pends on sparse and smooth coding in perceptual systems—that is, on qualities being represented
by relatively few neurons, and represented according to a continuous coding scheme rather than
one which divides stimuli into absolute categories (Lau et al. 2022).

Importantly, PRM claims that consciousness is not possible without qualities, so although qual-
ity space theory is not a theory of what makes a state conscious, the posits of this theory are putative
necessary conditions for consciousness. Our final indicator arising from HOTs is, therefore:

```
HOT-4 Sparse and smooth coding generating a “quality space”
```
This condition may be relatively readily met in AI: all deep neural networks use smooth rep-
resentation spaces, and sparseness can also be achieved by familiar machine learning techniques
(see section 3.1.3).


### 2.4 Other Theories and Conditions

Many scientific theories of consciousness have been proposed (see Seth & Bayne 2022 for a list).
In addition, there are influential theoretical proposals that are not exactly theories of conscious-
ness, but which bear on our investigation. Furthermore, there may be necessary conditions for
consciousness that are not explicitly emphasised in scientific theories because all humans meet
them (such as having a body), but which need to be considered in the context of AI. In this section,
we survey several relevant theories, proposals and conditions, before presenting our indicators in
section 2.5.

One theory that we do not discuss below is integrated information theory (IIT; Oizumi et al.
2014, Tononi & Koch 2015). The standard construal of IIT is incompatible with our working
assumption of computational functionalism; Tononi & Koch (2015) hold that a system that imple-
mented the same algorithm as the human brain would not be conscious if its components were of
the wrong kind. Relatedly, proponents of IIT claim that the theory implies that digital comput-
ers are unlikely to be conscious, whatever programs they run (Albantakis & Tononi 2021). As a
result, in contrast to other scientific theories, IIT does not imply that some AI systems built on
conventional hardware would be better candidates for consciousness than others; this makes it less
relevant to our project. It has recently been proposed that measures of information integration
may be correlated with “global states of consciousness” such as wakefulness, sleep and coma—a
paradigm called “weak IIT” (Michel & Lau 2020, Mediano et al. 2022). But the implications of
weak IIT for our project are limited: it suggests that measurable properties of integration and dif-
ferentiation matter for consciousness, but does not (yet) tell us which measures to rely on or how
to interpret their results when applied to artificial systems.

#### 2.4.1 Attention Schema Theory

The attention schema theory of consciousness (AST) claims that the human brain constructs a
model of attention, which represents—and may misrepresent—facts about the current objects of
attention. This model helps the brain to control attention, in a similar way to how the body schema
helps with control of bodily movements. Conscious experience depends on the contents of the
attention schema. For example, I will have the conscious experience of seeing an apple if the
schema represents that I am currently attending to an apple (Webb & Graziano 2015, Graziano
2019a). Attention schema theory claims that the workings of the attention schema explain our
intuitions about our experiences: because the attention schema does not represent the details of the
mechanism of attention, the theory claims, it seems to us that we are related to the stimulus (e.g.
an apple) in an immediate and seemingly mysterious way.

AST can be thought of as a higher-order theory of consciousness because it claims that con-
sciousness depends on higher-order representations of a particular kind (in this case, representa-
tions of our attention). Like other higher-order theories, it places special emphasis on our aware-
ness of our own mental states. Unlike most higher-order theories, however, AST has been devel-
oped with the specific aim of explaining what we believe and say about consciousness, such as
that we are conscious and that consciousness seems difficult to square with physical descriptions
of the world (that is, AST aims to solve the meta-problem of consciousness—see Chalmers 2018,


Graziano 2019b). Because it focuses on explaining why we (potentially mistakenly) believe certain
things about consciousness, AST could be construed as an attempt to explainawayconsciousness.
But it is also open to interpretation as an account of the conditions for consciousness.

```
AST gives us a further indicator of consciousness in AI:
```
AST-1: A predictive model representing and enabling control over the current state of
attention
Representing the current state of attention allows the mind to learn about both the effects of
attention and how attention is affected by events in the mind and the environment. Having a model,
therefore, makes it easier for the mind to learn to take attention-affecting actions because they will
have beneficial effects on other cognitive processes. A predictive model is especially valuable be-
cause it allows the mind to anticipate how the objects of attention might change, conditional on
changes in the mind or the environment, and make adjustments accordingly. These could include
preemptive adjustments, for instance when distraction from an important task is anticipated. At-
tention schema-like models which enable the effective control of attention could be valuable for
the increasing number of AI systems which employ attention—here understood as active control
of information flow (Liu et al. 2023).

#### 2.4.2 Predictive Processing

Predictive processing (PP) is presented as a comprehensive, unifying theory of human cognition,
and has been used as a framework for addressing many questions about the mind. Because it is
a general framework, some PP theorists describe it as a theoryforconsciousness, not a theory
ofconsciousness (Seth & Hohwy 2021, Seth & Bayne 2022)—a paradigm within which theories
of consciousness should be developed. However, advocates of PP have used it to explain many
specific features of conscious experience, such as the puzzling nature of “qualia” (Clark 2019) and
the phenomenology of emotion and embodiment (Seth 2021). Consciousness has been discussed
extensively by PP theorists, but relatively little direct attention has been given to the questions
which are most important for our purposes: what distinguishes conscious from non-conscious
systems, and what distinguishes conscious from non-conscious states within conscious systems
(Deane 2021, Hohwy 2022, Nave et al. 2022).

PP claims that the essence of human and animal cognition is minimisation of errors made by a
hierarchical generative model in predicting sensory stimulation. In perception, this model is con-
tinually generating predictions at multiple levels, each influenced by predictions at neighbouring
levels and in the immediate past, and by prediction error signals which ultimately arise from sen-
sory stimulation itself. This process is modulated by attention, and—according to the thesis of
‘active inference’—it can also control action because acting can be a means of reducing prediction
error. Adaptive actions will be selected if organisms predict their own success (Friston 2010).

Although PP is not a theory of consciousness, its popularity means that many researchers regard
predictive processing as a plausible necessary condition for consciousness. We, therefore, include
the use of predictive coding among our indicators:

```
PP-1 Input modules using predictive coding
```

In keeping with the “theoryforconsciousness” idea, the PP framework has been employed in
developments of GWT and HOT. Hohwy (2013) and Whyte (2019) propose that global broadcast
(via ignition) takes place when the process of perceptual inference settles on some representation
of the state of the environment as most probable, then makes this representation available as the
basis for active inference. Meanwhile, the higher-order state space theory adopts the PP framework
(Fleming 2020).

#### 2.4.3 Midbrain Theory

While the neuroscientific theories of consciousness we have discussed so far focus primarily on
cortical processes, Merker (2007) argues that the cortex is not necessary for consciousness. This
view has been particularly influential in recent discussions of consciousness in non-human ani-
mals. Merker’s proposal is that activity in parts of the midbrain and basal ganglia constitute a
“unified multimodal neural model of the agent within its environment, which is weighted by the
current needs and state of the agent” (Klein & Barron 2016), and that this activity is sufficient for
subjective experience. In Merker’s account, one midbrain region, the superior colliculus, integrates
information from spatial senses and the vestibular system to construct a model of the organism’s
position and movement in space. Other regions including the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray,
and parts of the basal ganglia bring in information about the organism’s physiological state and
contribute to identifying opportunities and selecting actions. In functional terms, the midbrain
theory claims that consciousness depends on “integrated spatiotemporal modeling” for action se-
lection (Klein & Barron 2016).

Birch (2022b) summarises and criticises evidence for the midbrain theory. For our purposes,
it is notable because it offers a particular perspective on the significance of cognitive integration
for consciousness. The midbrain theory proposes that the integration which is necessary for con-
sciousness arose to solve the biologically ancient problem of decision-making in complex mobile
animals, particularly the need to distinguish the effects of self-caused motion on perceptual input
(Merker 2005). Hence the midbrain theory emphasises the need to integrate specific kinds of in-
formation, such as spatial, affective, and homeostatic information, into a single common model.
This theory, therefore, gives us additional reason to believe that systems for purposeful navigation
of a body through space are necessary for consciousness, and thus contribute to the case for the
indicators we present in section 2.4.5.

#### 2.4.4 Unlimited Associative Learning

Another influential theory in animal consciousness literature is Ginsburg and Jablonka’s (2019)
unlimited associative learning framework (Birch et al. 2020). The proposal here is that the capacity
for unlimited associative learning (UAL) is an evolutionary “transition marker” for consciousness:
a single feature that indicates that an evolutionary transition to consciousness has taken place in a
given lineage. Ginsburg and Jabolanka identify UAL as a marker on the grounds that it requires
a combination of several “hallmarks” that are argued to be jointly sufficient for consciousness in
living organisms. The UAL framework, therefore, brings together a list of features that seem to be
related to consciousness and argues that they are unified by facilitating UAL.


Somewhat like this report, the UAL project aims to identify a set of jointly sufficient conditions
for consciousness. This set is summarised in the table below (which follows the presentation of
these conditions in Birch et al. 2020).

```
Hallmarks of consciousness according to UAL
Global accessibility integrating sensory, evaluative and mnemonic information
Selective attention
Integration over time through forms of short-term memory
Embodiment and agency
Self-other registration, used in constructing a representation of the moving
body in space
Flexible value system capable of revaluation and weighing needs
Binding/unification of features to form compound stimuli, enabling discrimi-
nation of complex patterns
Intentionality, i.e. representation of the body and environment
```
This list of conditions is similar to the conditions which are emerging from our work in this
section (like us, Ginsburg and Jablonka examined scientific theories of consciousness in developing
their list). The global accessibility and selective attention conditions are met by systems that
implement global workspace architectures. The integration over time condition may be as well; we
discuss integration over time in section 2.4.6. Several of the other conditions are related to agency
and embodiment, which we discuss in section 2.4.5. These include not only the embodiment
and agency condition itself but also self-other registration (which also aligns with the midbrain
theory) and having a flexible value system. We take it that the binding/unification condition will
be met by any neural network-based AI system because these systems are designed to learn to
discriminate complex patterns. The final condition, that the system should represent its body and
the environment, raises philosophical questions about intentionality which we will not go into
here. But any naturalistic theory of intentionality is likely to entail that systems that meet the
other conditions will also meet this one because the other conditions entail the performance of the
functions which might ground intentionality.

What about the capacity for unlimited associative learning itself? This could be argued to be
an indicator of consciousness in artificial systems. In the UAL framework, it is characterised as
an open-ended capacity for associative learning. In particular, to have this capacity an organism
must be capable of conditioning with compound stimuli and novel stimuli and of quickly and
flexibly updating the values it associates with stimuli, actions and outcomes. It must also be capable
of second-order conditioning, meaning that it can link together chains of associations, and trace
conditioning, which is learning an association when there is a time gap between stimuli. Having
the capacity for unlimited associated learning, therefore, implies that an organism or system can
integrate information across modalities and over time, and that can evaluate stimuli and change
these evaluations in response to new information.

This capacity is also, therefore, linked to many of our indicators. Integration of information
from different modalities and flexible learning are emphasised by GWT. PRM also suggests simi-
lar capacities by requiring a general-purpose belief-formation and decision-making system, which
receives input from any sensory modality subject to metacognitive monitoring. Evaluation and


evaluative learning are closely connected with agency. AI systems that combine agency with indi-
cators implying integration and flexibility may be particularly good candidates for consciousness,
because they will share notable cognitive capacities with the animals which are, according to UAL,
most likely to be conscious. Furthermore, having an architecture of the kind described by either
GWT or PRM is perhaps particularly good evidence for consciousness if it facilitates flexible
learning.

However, it is possible that the capacity for unlimited associative learning could be achieved in
AI systems in different ways—using architectures that are both unlike those described by theories
like GWT, and unlike those belonging to animals that share this capacity. These systems might
have this capacity while lacking some of the hallmarks of consciousness identified by Ginsburg
and Jablonka. This would undermine the argument for consciousness in such systems, which is
a reason to doubt whether UAL itself is a good indicator for consciousness in artificial systems.
Another reason is that the status of the UAL hypothesis is very different from that of the other
theories we have considered: rather than claiming to identify the mechanism underlying conscious
experience, it claims to identify a behavioural marker for consciousness in living organisms. For
these reasons, we do not include the capacity for UAL in our list of indicators.

#### 2.4.5 Agency and Embodiment

Current AI systems often relate to their environments in very different ways from humans and
other animals, and it can be argued that these differences are evidence against consciousness in
such systems. For example, consider the well-known image classifier AlexNet (Krizhevsky et
al. 2012), a relatively small and simple DNN trained by supervised learning. The beings which
we usually take to be conscious are very different from AlexNet: they are agents which pursue
goals and make choices; they are alive and have bodies; and they continually interact with the
environment in a way that involves storing and integrating information over short periods of time.
AlexNet, in contrast, has the function of classifying images but does not take actions or pursue
any goal. It is physically realised in the sense that the weights and other features which define it
are stored in physical memory devices, but it does not have a body. And it processes inputs that
are separated in time and independent of each other and its outputs in feedforward passes that do
not change its state. In this and the following section, we discuss whether further indicators of
consciousness can be identified among these “big-picture” differences between humans and some
AI systems.

As we will see in this section, scientists and philosophers have argued that various properties
related to agency and embodiment are necessary for consciousness. We survey some of these
arguments, identifying possible indicators, then discuss whether they can be formulated in ways
that are consistent with computational functionalism. We close the subsection by adding two more
indicators to our list.

##### 2.4.5(a) Agency

One argument for the claim that agency is necessary for consciousness is that this is implied by
many scientific theories. Most of the theories of consciousness we have discussed make some


reference to agency.

PRM is particularly clear that agency is a necessary condition for consciousness. PRM claims
that the subsystem that discriminates between sensory signals and noise must output to a “general
belief-formation and rational decision-making system” (Lau & Michel 2021). One of the founda-
tional ideas on which the theory is built is that conscious perceptual experiences have an “assertoric
force” which may be explained either as a certain kind of persistence of the signal as an input to
this decision-making system or as a strong disposition to form corresponding beliefs. What dis-
tinguishes beliefs from other representations, on most philosophical accounts, is in part their use
in decisions about how to act (Stich 1978, Dretske 1988, Schwitzgebel 2021). We have already
formulated an indicator that expresses this aspect of PRM, but the point remains that agency is a
prerequisite for the functions cited in this theory.

The midbrain theory explicitly requires agency, since it claims that the function of the midbrain
is to integrate information for action selection, and GWT also emphasises agency, without being
quite so clear that it is necessary. Dehaene and Naccache (2001) claim that representation in the
global workspace is needed for information to be available for intentional action, in keeping with
their presentation of GWT as a theory of access consciousness, and, therefore, of the availability of
information for rational agency. The UAL hypothesis claims that “agency and embodiment” and a
“flexible value system” (Birch et al. 2020) are hallmarks of consciousness.

There are also independent arguments in philosophy that agency is necessary for consciousness
(Evans 1982, Hurley 1998, Clark & Kiverstein 2008). Hurley (1998) claims that consciousness
requires intentional agency, which she spells out as agency in which:

... [the system’s] actions depend holistically on relationships between what
it perceives and intends, or between what it believes and desires. Relations
between stimuli and responses are not invariant but reflect the rational re-
lations between what it perceives and intends and various possibilities of
mistake or misrepresentation. (p. 137)

Hurley’s argument for this claim is related to the sensorimotor theory of consciousness and
theories of embodied and enactive cognition, which we explore further below. A key idea is that
consciousness requires a perspective or point of view on the environment, and embodied agency
can give rise to such a perspective. Hurley also argues that part of what it is to be conscious is
to have access to the contents of one’s conscious experiences and that this requires the ability to
act intentionally in the light of these contents. However, other philosophers argue that it is at least
conceptually possible that there could be conscious experience in entities that are entirely incapable
of action (Strawson 1994, Bayne et al. 2020).

There are three possible indicators of consciousness suggested by these considerations (in addi-
tion to indicator HOT-3, arising from PRM). These are: being an agent of any kind; having flexible
goals or values, as suggested by advocates of UAL; and being an intentional agent, as suggested
by Hurley. The latter two are strictly stronger conditions than the first, but that does not in itself
imply that any should be excluded. It could be that agents in general are significantly stronger
candidates for consciousness than non-agents, and intentional agents (say) are also significantly
stronger candidates than other agents, in which case agency and intentional agency would both be


useful indicators.

In their classic AI textbook, Russell and Norvig write that “an agent is anything that can be
viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through
activators” (2010, p. 34). This is a very liberal definition of agency. AlexNet meets these condi-
tions—in fact,allAI systems meet them—and so do many simple artifacts, such as thermostats.
So it is too liberal a notion of agency for our purposes.

A more substantive notion of agency can be defined by adding three conditions to Russell and
Norvig’s account. First, it is a plausible condition for agency that the system’s outputs affect its
subsequent inputs. Without this, a system can only respond to inputs individually, as opposed to
interacting with an environment. AlexNet does not meet this condition because, in general, the
labels it produces as output do not affect which images it is subsequently given as input. This
relates to the second condition, which is that agents pursue goals. We typically think of this as
involving ongoing interaction with an environment, in which outputs are selected because they
will bring the system closer to the goal—that is, they will change the environment state, affecting
their own input, so that the goal can be more readily achieved by future outputs.

The third condition is that the system mustlearnto produce goal-conducive outputs. This point
is emphasised by Dretske (1988, 1999), who argues that a system’s output is only an action if it is
explained by the system’s own sensitivity to the benefit of producing that output when receiving
a given input. A system’s being sensitive to benefits in this way is manifested in its learning
to produce beneficial outputs. Dretske’s idea is that this distinguishes some of the behaviour of
animals, which he thinks of as exhibiting agency, from the behaviour of plants, which have evolved
to respond to stimuli in particular ways, rather than learning to do so, and artefacts like thermostats,
which have been designed to produce particular responses. In a similar vein, Russell and Norvig
say that an agent lacks autonomy if its success depends on its designer’s prior knowledge of the
task (2010, p. 39).

Reinforcement learning (RL) research explicitly aims to build artificial agents which pursue
goals (Sutton & Barto 2018), and typical RL systems meet all three of these conditions. In RL,
the task is to maximise cumulative reward over an episode of interaction with an environment in
which the system’s outputs affect its subsequent inputs. So there is a strong case that typical RL
systems meet substantive criteria for agency (Butlin 2022, 2023).^10 However, this is not to say that
RL is necessary for agency—there are other methods by which systems can learn from feedback
to more effectively pursue goals. It is also important to note that the criteria for agency suggested
here are relatively minimal.

According to UAL advocates, there are two senses in which agents’ goals or values can be flex-
ible (Bronfman et al. 2016, Birch et al. 2020). One way is that the agent can be capable of learning
new goals, such as through classical conditioning, in which a novel stimulus can come to be valued
through association with one that the agent already values. The other is that the agent’s goals and
values can be sensitive to its changing needs, as in cases in which animals’ preferences change
depending on their homeostatic condition. A requirement for flexibility of either kind would be
somewhat stronger than the requirement for agency, although even very simple agents tend to be
capable of either classical conditioning or habit learning, in which new actions are reinforced.

(^10) A possible exception is so-called “bandit” systems, which learn from reward signals in environments in which outputs
do not affect subsequent inputs.


There are better arguments that the second form of flexibility is connected to consciousness: it
may require a centralised architecture in which multiple sources of value-relevant information are
integrated, and it would also mean that the motivational significance of states of different kinds,
relating to different goals or values, must be compared. One suggestion in the scientific and philo-
sophical literature is that conscious valence—that is, the degree to which conscious experiences
are pleasurable or unpleasant—could constitute a “common currency” making such comparisons
possible (Cabanac 1992, Carruthers 2018). So it is arguably flexible responsiveness to competing
goals that is most compelling.

One way to spell out the idea of intentional agency, in which action depends on rational rela-
tions between belief-like and desire-like states, is through the distinction made in animal behaviour
research between “goal-directed” and “habitual” behaviour (Heyes & Dickinson 1990). In the goal-
directed case, the animal can learn independently about the value of an outcome and about actions
that might lead to it. It can then combine this knowledge with information about other actions and
outcomes, in instrumental reasoning, to make a choice. Action, therefore, depends holistically on
the animal’s “beliefs” and “desires”. Computational neuroscience interprets goal-directed action
selection in animals as an implementation of model-based RL (Dolan & Dayan 2013). On this
understanding, the intentional agency which Hurley emphasises is similar to the form of agency
which is required by PRM. What matters for PRM is that the agent relies on the accuracy of a set
of representations that are belief-like in that they are used in instrumental reasoning for action se-
lection. This gives reality-monitoring its function: accurate representations in perceptual systems,
caused by sensory stimulation, should be used to update this set, while representations without this
connection with reality should not.

##### 2.4.5(b) Embodiment

On both the minimal and intentional conceptions of agency, it seems possible for a system to be
an agent without being embodied. For example, consider AlphaGo, the first AI system to beat the
world’s best human Go players (Silver et al. 2016). AlphaGo was an agent but lacked the features
which seem to distinguish embodied systems. Embodied systems are located at particular positions
in their environments, and the actions and observations available to them are constrained by their
positions. They also typically have relatively complex effectors, which they must continuously
control over extended periods in order to perform effective actions. Their outputs are movements,
and these have some direct and systematic effects on their inputs—for example, turning one’s head
has a systematic effect on visual input—as well as less direct effects. These ideas are described in
a philosophical account of embodiment by Clark (2008, p. 207), who writes that:

... the body is... the locus of willed action, the point of sensorimotor
confluence, the gateway to intelligent offloading, and the stable (although
not permanently fixed) platform whose features and relations can be relied
upon (without being represented) in the computations underlying some
intelligent performances.

The point about “intelligent offloading” here is a reference to the thesis of embodied and ex-
tended cognition: embodied agents can exploit properties of their bodies and environments in many


ways to make the cognitive tasks they face more tractable, such as by recording information in the
environment.

One aspect of embodiment which is thought to be connected with consciousness is having what
Hurley (1998) calls a “perspective”. This also requires agency. According to Hurley,

```
Having a perspective means in part that what you experience and perceive
depends systematically on what you do, as well as vice versa. Moreover, it
involves keeping track... of the ways in which what you experience and
perceive depends on what you do. (p. 140)
```
For embodied agents that move through their environments, sensory inputs can change either
because the environment changes, or because the agent changes its position in the environment,
either actively or passively. To distinguish these cases, agents must keep track of their own active
movements, and learn how these affect inputs. This will allow them to predict the sensory con-
sequences of their own actions, which will typically be tightly coupled to movements, and thus
distinguish them from exogenous changes in the environment. Passive movements can also be
distinguished because these will cause the kinds of changes in input which are characteristic of
movement in the absence of corresponding outputs. These functions involve the agent’s implicitly
distinguishing between a self, located in a moving body, and an environment in which its move-
ment takes place. Consciousness arguably requires that the subject has a single perspective or point
of view on the environment, and this account aims to explain how embodied agency gives rise to
such a perspective (Hurley 1998, Merker 2005, Godfrey-Smith 2019).

Relatedly, according to the sensorimotor theory of perceptual consciousness, conscious expe-
riences are activities of interaction with the environment which constitute exercises of implicit,
practical sensorimotor knowledge (Hurley 1998, O’Regan & Noe 2001, No ̈ ̈e 2004, Kiverstein
2007). A simple application of sensorimotor knowledge is moving one’s head in order to see an
object from a different perspective. Like Hurley’s proposal, this theory implies that learning a
model of output-input contingencies and using this model in perception is a necessary condition
for consciousness. The midbrain theory also suggests that consciousness is associated with the
presence of an integrated model of the embodied self in its environment, used in perception, action
selection and control.

However, to capture the idea of embodiment as opposed to mere agency, we need to specify
further features of the output-input model—which might also be called a “transition model” or a
“forward model”. AlphaGo, our example of a non-embodied agent, used a model of this form in
Monte Carlo tree search, a planning algorithm that involves evaluating the expected consequences
of possible actions.

One way in which output-input models in embodied systems may be distinctive is by repre-
senting the direct and systematic effects that movements have on sensory inputs. This condition
is not necessarily satisfied by Go-playing systems, because each of the inputs they receive may be
affected by their opponents’ moves. Furthermore, embodied systems may also be distinctive in the
way they use such models. The employment of an output-input model in perception to distinguish
endogenous from exogenous change is one possible example of a characteristic use because it is
required when sensory input depends on the position and orientation of a moving body.


A second way of using output-input models which may be distinctive of embodied systems is
in motor control. Embodied systems often have effectors with multiple degrees of freedom which
must be controlled in precise and responsive ways, and it has been argued that forward models
(as they are called in this literature) have several uses which are specific to this context (Miall
& Wolpert 1996, McNamee & Wolpert 2019). In particular, forward models can help embodied
agents to estimate and adjust the positions of their effectors in the course of action, by providing a
representation of the expected position at each moment. Discrepancies between these expectations
and either sensory feedback or internal representations of goal states could be used for online
adjustment.

In addition to agency and embodiment, a further possible necessary condition for consciousness
is that conscious systems must be self-producing, self-maintaining, “autopoietic” systems (Matu-
rana & Varela 1991, Thompson 2005, 2007, Seth 2021, Aru et al. 2023). That is, they must sustain
their existence and organisation through their own ongoing activity. This feature is characteristic of
living things, which continually repair themselves and homeostatically regulate their temperatures
and the balance of chemicals present in their tissues. Self-maintaining activity usually, perhaps
always, involves “proto-cognitive” processes of sensing and responding (Godfrey-Smith 2016).
Advocates of this idea refer to concepts such as agency, selfhood and autonomy in arguing that
self-maintenance is necessary for consciousness. For instance, Thompson (2005) writes:

```
This self-producing organization defines the system’s identity and deter-
mines a perspective or point of view in relation to the environment. Sys-
tems organized in this way enact or bring forth what counts as information
for them; they are not transducers or functions for converting input instruc-
tions into output products. For these reasons, it is legitimate to invoke the
concepts of selfhood and agency to describe them. (p. 418)
```
Those who are also sympathetic to predictive processing, such as Seth (2021), think of self-
maintenance in living tissues as a similar process to prediction error minimisation in the brain—they
are both instances of free energy minimisation, or “self-evidencing” (Hohwy 2022). More pro-
saically, engaging in self-maintenance gives an extra reason for systems to model their own states,
is related to having flexible goals, and arguably adds a dimension of valence to representations of
the self and environment. On this last point, however, it is not clear why agency in the service of
self-maintenance should be distinguished from agency directed at “external” goals.

Building on this line of thought, Godfrey-Smith (2016) argues that self-maintaining activity is
only at all readily possible by virtue of the way that molecules behave at the nanometre scale when
immersed in water. There is continual random activity at this scale, in this context, which can be
marshalled to support metabolic processes. On this basis, Godfrey-Smith suggests that artificial
systems can only bear coarse-grained functional similarities to living organisms and that these will
not be sufficient for consciousness. So another proposed necessary condition is that a conscious
system must undergo metabolic processes realised at the nanoscale. Man and Damasio (2019) also
suggest that self-maintenance, and thus consciousness, may depend on systems’ specific material
composition.


##### 2.4.5(c) Agency and embodiment indicators

The proposal that consciousness depends on material composition is clearly incompatible with
computational functionalism, so we can set it aside. However, the compatibility of the other pro-
posals we have discussed with computational functionalism is a more complicated matter. The
issue is the same in each case: natural formulations of the putative indicators make reference to
conditions external to the system. This is incompatible with computational functionalism if a sim-
ilar system could perform the same computations in different external conditions.

For example, consider the claim that self-maintenance is necessary for consciousness, and
suppose that for a system to be self-maintaining in the relevant sense, it must persist in part because
it keeps track of certain inputs or internal states and acts to regulate them. It seems that for any
system that does this, there could be another that performs the same computations—keeping track
of the same inputs or internal states and using the same outputs to regulate them—but which does
not persist for this reason. Perhaps the system works to keep an “energy measure” from dropping
too low, but in fact, it would persist even if this measure fell to zero, and its energy is supplied by
an external operator in a way that does not depend on its behaviour.

If agency or embodiment are necessary for consciousness, these conditions may be incom-
patible with computational functionalism for similar reasons. These conditions require that the
system’s inputs are sensitive to its outputs. But in principle, it is possible for a system to exist in an
environment in which its inputs do not depend on its outputs, and yet receive, by chance, patterns
of inputs and outputs which are consistent with this dependency. Such a system might perform the
same computations as one that genuinely interacted with its environment.

To avoid this incompatibility, indicators concerning agency, perspective, or self-maintenance
should be formulated “narrowly”, in ways that do not make reference to external conditions. For
instance, rather than saying that a system is more likely to be conscious if it pursues goals by
interacting with its environment, we can say that it is more likely to be conscious if it learns from
feedback and selects actionsin such a way as topursue goals by interacting with its environment.
Similarly, we can say that a system is embodied if it has a model of how its outputs affect its
inputs, which represents some systematic effects, and uses this model in perception or control.
There is a sense in which this system might misrepresent itself as an embodied agent, even if it has
learnt this model, because it may be that the apparently systematic contingencies suggested by its
past observations are mere coincidences. However, only embodiment conditions on which this is
enough for consciousness are consistent with computational functionalism. Notably, this account
of embodiment allows that systems controlling virtual avatars can count as embodied.

In this section, we have seen several indicators which could be added to our list. These include:
being an agent; having flexible goals or values; being an intentional agent; having a perspective;
having a body; and being self-maintaining. However, there are also reasons to exclude some of
these. We already have an indicator requiring a relatively sophisticated form of agency with belief-
like representations: indicator HOT-3, derived from PRM. An intentional agency indicator would
be too similar to this one. And although a narrow formulation of a self-maintenance indicator is
possible, which would be compatible with computational functionalism, this would be contrary to
the spirit of the philosophical theories which emphasise self-maintenance. The ideas of being an
agent and having flexible goals are closely related, and the main way in which flexible goals add to


the case for consciousness is through the argument for centralisation and a common motivational
currency, so we combine these in one indicator.

```
We, therefore, adopt the following two further indicators of consciousness:
```
```
AE-1 Agency: Learning from feedback and selecting outputs so as to pursue goals, es-
pecially where this involves flexible responsiveness to competing goals
```
```
AE-2 Embodiment: Modeling output-input contingencies, including some systematic
effects, and using this model in perception or control
```
#### 2.4.6 Time and Recurrence

Human conscious experience seems to be highly integrated over time. We seem to undergo expe-
riences that are themselves extended in time, and constitute conscious perception of temporally-
extended phenomena, such as when we hear a bird’s song or watch it fly from one perch to another.
What’s more, from the time we wake up each day we seem to experience a flow of several hours
of continuous, integrated experience. Whether or not this feature of our experience should be ex-
plained in terms of memory (Dainton 2000, Phillips 2018b), our conscious experiences also seem
to be deeply influenced by our memories. This integration might be seen as a reason to doubt that
consciousness is possible in ANNs whose activity consists of temporally discrete forward passes;
the point is particularly vivid if we imagine that there are long intervening periods (weeks, years)
between passes. However, several responses can be made to this objection.

One response is that it is not obvious that consciousness is necessarily integrated over time.
Patients with dense amnesia seem to have a series of brief, disjointed experiences (Wilson et al.
1995). These experiences may not be static, but it seems possible to imagine a conscious being that
had only a succession of brief, static, discrete experiences. There is a question about what would
make it the case that these were the experiences of a single subject, but it is not obvious either that
integration over time is the only possible grounds for the persistence of the subject of conscious
experience, or that there could not be conscious systems without a persisting subject.

Furthermore, it is possible that the apparent temporal continuity of human experience is illu-
sory. Philosophers and scientists defend a range of views about how our experiences are generated
over time (Dainton 2023), but these include the view that we undergo discrete, static experiences in
rapid succession, generated by sampling from unconscious activity (VanRullen 2016, Herzog et al.
2020). Prosser (2016) calls this the “dynamic snapshot” view. The content of discrete experiences
may be informed by unconscious retention of information, and be capable of representing change
despite being static. For example, when watching a bird I might undergo a brief static visual expe-
rience representing not only that the bird is in a certain location, but that it is moving in a certain
way. On this model, there may be no special integration between successive experiences, since the
appearance of such integration can be explained by their being sampled at a fairly high frequency
from smoothly-changing unconscious perceptual activity which in turn reflects smooth continuous
change in the environment.

Despite these points, it does seem that algorithmic recurrence (i.e. recurrence as it is usually
understood in machine learning; see section 2.1.3) is likely to be necessary for conscious expe-


rience with a human-like temporal character. For conscious experience to represent change or
continuity in the environment in any way, information about the past must be retained and used
to influence present processing. This is a further reason to take algorithmic recurrence to be an
indicator of consciousness, as expressed in our indicator RPT-1. Integration over time, and, there-
fore, recurrent processing, is also emphasised by the midbrain and sensorimotor theories, the UAL
framework and some PP theorists.

### 2.5 Indicators of Consciousness

Each of the theories and proposals which we have discussed in sections 2.1-2.4 is of some value in
assessing whether a given AI system is likely to be conscious, or how likely it is that a conscious
system could be built in the near future. They are each supported by evidence and arguments
that have some force. We, the authors of this report, have varying opinions on the strength of
the evidence and arguments supporting each theory, as well as varying background views about
consciousness that influence our assessments of the likelihood of near-term AI consciousness.
Here we summarise the findings of section 2 by giving a list of indicators of consciousness drawn
from the theories and proposals we have discussed.

Our claim about these indicators is that they jointly amount to a rubric, informed by current
views in the science of consciousness, for assessing the likelihood of consciousness in particular
AI systems. Systems that have more of these features are better candidates for consciousness.
Theories of consciousness make stronger claims than this, such as that some of these are necessary
conditions for consciousness, and that combinations are jointly sufficient. We do not endorse
these stronger claims, but we do claim that in using these indicators one should bear in mind
how they relate to theories and to each other—some combinations of indicators will amount to
more a compelling case for consciousness than others. The extent to which these indicators are
individually probability-raising also varies, with some being plausibly necessary conditions that do
not make consciousness significantly more likely in isolation (perhaps including RPT-1, GWT-1
and HOT-1).


Recurrent processing theory
RPT-1: Input modules using algorithmic recurrence
RPT-2: Input modules generating organised,
integrated perceptual representations

RPT-1 and RPT-2 are largely independent
indicators. RPT-1 is also supported by
temporal integration arguments.
Global workspace theory
GWT-1: Multiple specialised systems capable of
operating in parallel (modules)
GWT-2: Limited capacity workspace, entailing a
bottleneck in information flow and a selective
attention mechanism
GWT-3: Global broadcast: availability of
information in the workspace to all modules
GWT-4: State-dependent attention, giving rise to
the capacity to use the workspace to query modules
in succession to perform complex tasks

```
GWT claims that these are necessary and
jointly sufficient. GWT-1 through GWT-4
build on one another. GWT-3 and GWT-4
entail RPT-1.
```
Computational higher-order theories
HOT-1: Generative, top-down or noisy perception
modules
HOT-2: Metacognitive monitoring distinguishing
reliable perceptual representations from noise
HOT-3: Agency guided by a general
belief-formation and action selection system, and a
strong disposition to update beliefs in accordance
with the outputs of metacognitive monitoring
HOT-4: Sparse and smooth coding generating a
“quality space”

```
PRM claims that these are necessary and
jointly sufficient. HOT-1 through HOT-3
build on one another; HOT-4 is
independent. The first clause of HOT-3 is
also supported by arguments concerning
intentional/flexible agency, and entails
AE-1.
```
Attention schema theory
AST-1: A predictive model representing and
enabling control over the current state of attention
Predictive processing
PP-1: Input modules using predictive coding Entails RPT-1 and HOT-1.
Agency and embodiment
AE-1: Agency: Learning from feedback and
selecting outputs so as to pursue goals, especially
where this involves flexible responsiveness to
competing goals
AE-2: Embodiment: Modeling output-input
contingencies, including some systematic effects,
and using this model in perception or control

```
Both indicators are also supported by
midbrain and UAL theories, and to some
extent by GWT, PRM and PP, especially
AE-1. Systems meeting AE-2 are likely, but
not guaranteed, to also meet AE-1.

## 3 Consciousness in AI

What do the findings of section 2 imply about consciousness in current and near-future AI systems?
In this section, we address this question in two ways. First, in section 3.1 we discuss the indicator
properties in turn, asking how they could be implemented in artificial systems. Second, in section
3.2 we examine several existing AI systems as case studies illustrating both how the indicators
should be used, and how our method evaluates some current systems. We discuss large language
models and the Perceiver architecture (Jaegle et al. 2021a, b) with a particular focus on global
workspace theory, and consider whether any of a selection of recent systems—PaLM-E (Driess
et al. 2023), a “virtual rodent” (Merel et al. 2019) and AdA (DeepMind Adaptive Agents Team
2023)—are embodied agents.

Reflecting on how to construct systems with the indicator properties, and on whether they
are present in current systems, illustrates some crucial lessons of our work. One is that assess-
ing whether a system possesses an indicator property typically involves some interpretation of the
description of the property; the descriptions of indicator properties, like the theories from which
they are drawn, contain ambiguities that possible implementations draw out. To describe indica-
tor properties with so much precision that this kind of interpretation is not needed would mean
going well beyond the claims made by scientific theories of consciousness, and these more pre-
cise claims would also tend to be less well-supported by the available empirical evidence. We
hope that interdisciplinary research on consciousness, which brings together neuroscientists and
AI researchers, will result in greater precision in theories of consciousness and the development of
empirical methods that can provide evidence supporting more precise theories.

A second lesson from the discussion in this section is that in assessing AI systems for con-
sciousness, it is not always sufficient to consider the system’s architecture, training and behaviour.
For example, we may know that a system is a recurrent neural network and has been trained via RL
to successfully control a virtual body to perform a task, and yet not know whether its performance
relies on a learned model of output-input contingencies. In such a case, we may not know whether
the system satisfies our embodiment condition. Interpretability methods, such as examining the
information encoded in hidden layers (Olah et al. 2018), would be required to determine whether
the system has acquired such a model in the course of training.

The third lesson is that, despite the challenges involved in applying theories of consciousness
to AI, there is a strong case that most or all of the conditions for consciousness suggested by
current computational theories can be met using existing techniques in AI. This is not to say that
current AI systems are likely to be conscious—there is also the issue of whether they combine
existing techniques in the right ways, and in any case, there is uncertainty about both computational
functionalism and current theories—but it does suggest that conscious AI is not merely a remote
possibility in the distant future. If it is possible at all to build conscious AI systems without
radically new hardware, it may well be possible now.


### 3.1 Implementing Indicator Properties in AI

#### 3.1.1 Implementing RPT and PP

We begin our investigation of the indicators by discussing the two indicators taken from RPT, algo-
rithmic recurrence and perceptual organisation, along with the PP indicator (i.e., indicators RPT-1,
RPT-2 and PP-1). The reason for including PP here is that, as we will see, recent studies have
found that using predictive coding in computer vision can facilitate processing that is more sensi-
tive to global features of visual scenes, in contrast to the local-feature sensitivity of feedforward
convolutional neural networks which perform well in classification tasks.

Algorithmic recurrence (RPT-1) is a feature of many deep learning architectures, including
recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recur-
rent unit networks (GRUs) (LeCun et al. 2015). Building systems that possess indicator property
RPT-1 is, therefore, straightforward. Although they are less widely used, there are also methods
for implementing predictive coding (which is a form of algorithmic recurrence) in artificial sys-
tems (Lotter et al. 2017, Oord et al. 2019, Millidge et al. 2022). These systems meet indicator
PP-1. Furthermore, recurrent neural networks trained on prediction tasks and optimised for energy
efficiency self-organise into distinct populations of “prediction” and “error” units (Ali et al. 2022).

Turning to perceptual organisation (RPT-2), artificial vision models such as deep convolutional
neural networks (DCNNs), are already both highly successful and often claimed to be good models
of human vision (Kietzmann et al. 2019, Lindsay 2021, Mehrer et al. 2021, Zhuang et al. 2021).
However, the claim that current systems are good models of human vision has recently been crit-
icised (Bowers et al. 2022, Quilty-Dunn et al. 2022), and, more to the point, the human-level
performance in visual object recognition that DCNNs achieve does not entail that they represent
organised visual scenes. Bowers et al. (2022) and Quilty-Dunn et al. (2022) both cite evidence that
DCNNs trained to classify objects are more sensitive to local shapes and textures than to global
shapes, and tend to ignore relations between parts of objects, suggesting that they do not employ
representations of integrated scenes. Conwell and Ullman (2022) found that the recent image
generation model DALL-E 2 performed poorly when prompted to generate a scene with objects
arranged in unfamiliar ways.

From the point of view of RPT, these points might be taken to show that the models in question
are capable of categorising features of visual stimuli, a function which is said to be performed un-
consciously in humans, but are not capable of further functions up to and including the generation
of organised, integrated representations of visual scenes, some of which may require consciousness
(Lamme 2020). However, other current systems, including predictive coding networks, do perform
some of these further functions.

PredNet, a predictive coding network
trained to predict the next frame of video in-
puts, is notable partly because success at this
task seems to require representation of the ob-
jects that make up a scene and their spatial
relations (Lotter et al. 2017). Furthermore,
there is evidence that PredNet units respond
to illusory contours in the Kanizsa illusion,
the perception of which depends on inferring
the presence of objects from the wider con-
text (Lotter et al. 2020). Extending this find-
ing, Pang et al. (2021) used a technique for
adding feedback predictive coding connections
to a feedforward DCNN and found further ev-
idence that this predictive coding network, but
not the initial feedforward model, was sensi-
tive to the Kanizsa illusion. However, Lamme
(2020) claims that the Kanizsa illusion requires only perceptual “inference”, not perceptual organ-
isation as understood by RPT.

Beyond predictive coding, systems of other kinds have been developed specifically to represent
objects and their relations in visual scenes. MONet, which uses a recurrent attention mechanism
and a variational autoencoder to decompose and reconstruct scenes, is one example (Burgess et al.
2019). In this system, the attention network picks out individual objects in turn for identification
and reconstruction by the variational autoencoder. Another system, the Object Scene Representa-
tion Transformer, is trained to predict the appearance of complex scenes from new angles, a task
which (like video prediction) requires the representation of scenes as made up of objects in space
(Sajjadi et al. 2022). Representing organised perceptual scenes is an active area of research in
machine learning for which several methods have already been developed (Greff et al. 2020).

#### 3.1.2 Implementing GWT

Implementing GWT in artificial systems has been the subject of several studies, including recent
research by VanRullen and Kanai (2021) and Goyal et al. (2022). Here we give brief overviews of
these two studies before discussing indicators GWT-1 through GWT-4 in turn.

VanRullen and Kanai’s (2021) proposal involves a set of specialised neural modules, at least
some of which are generative networks that can produce behavioural outputs or drive sensory
processing top-down. Each of these modules has its own low-dimensional latent space in which
key information is represented. The modules are integrated by a workspace, which is a shared
latent space trained to perform unsupervised translation of representations in the latent spaces of
the modules so that the information they carry is available to the others. The workspace has a
lower capacity than the sum of the module latent spaces, and a task-dependent key-query attention
mechanism is used to determine which information it broadcasts. So this architecture includes
the important features of a bottleneck, global broadcast and state-dependent selection. However,


this work is a “roadmap” to a possible implementation, rather than a working system. It faces
a substantial open question about how the attention mechanism could be trained to select among
the potential inputs to the workspace, and especially how this could achieve the sequences of
operations of attention needed to control extended, functional sequences of operations by relevant
modules.

Meanwhile, Goyal et al. (2022) experimented with a method for implementing global workspace
which similarly involved using key-query attention to select which of multiple modules would
write to a shared space, with the contents of the shared space then being broadcast to all mod-
ules. In this case, the modules were trained together to generate mutually usable representations,
avoiding the need for translation in the workspace. A limitation of the specific implementations
developed in this work was that the “modules” were elements processing tokens in a sequence
or parts of an image, so it is questionable whether they were specialised subsystems capable of
operating in parallel; instead, they each contributed in similar ways to the performance of a single
task.

Although neither of these studies produced a working system that clearly satisfies all four GWT
indicators, this does seem to be a realistic objective, as we will argue by considering the indicators
in turn. Indicator GWT-1 states that the system must have specialised systems, or modules, capable
of working in parallel. To make global broadcast possible, these modules must be implemented by
recurrent neural networks, unless they are “output” modules for the system as a whole, which do
not provide information to the workspace. The modules might take as input:

1. Sensory input in one or more modalities.
2. Input from a small number of other modules that typically work in tandem. For in-
    stance, a “saccade” module might take input from a “visual saliency” module in order
    to enable quick bottom-up saccades towards potentially important objects.
3. Top-down signals coming from an executive Global Workspace module.

These modules might be trained independently on narrow tasks, as suggested by VanRullen
and Kanai (2021). Or they might be jointly trained end-to-end with the workspace in order to
achieve some system-wide objective, from which module specialisation to subtasks would natu-
rally emerge. The end-to-end training approach was employed by Goyal et al. (2022), although
for relatively simple tasks (see also Goyal et al. 2020).

The second element of an implementation of GWT is a limited-capacity workspace, which is
a further neural module with different properties. The simplest way to limit the capacity of the
workspace is to limit the number of dimensions of its activity space. Another interesting option
is to train a recurrent neural network that exhibits attractor dynamics. An attractor is a state in a
dynamical system such that when that state is reached, it will remain stable in the absence of inputs
or noise to the system. The reason that attractor dynamics limits capacity is that it induces a many-
to-one mapping from initial conditions in a neural trajectory to attractors (any neural trajectory
that enters an attractor’s basin of attraction will converge to that attractor). Thus, these attractor
dynamics induce an information bottleneck by contracting the size of the space of stable states.
Ji, Elmoznino et al. (2023) argue that attractor dynamics in the workspace can help to explain the
apparent richness and ineffability of conscious experience.


For indicator GWT-3, global broadcast, the basic requirement is that all modules take workspace
representations as input. As we have seen, this means that some mechanism must be in place to
ensure that these inputs can be used by all modules, such as the translation mechanism proposed
by VanRullen and Kanai (2021). In the global neuronal workspace theory developed by Dehaene
and colleagues (Dehaene & Naccache 2001, Dehaene & Changeaux 2011, Mashour et al. 2020),
the workspace exhibits particular dynamic properties: for a representation to be in the workspace
and globally broadcast, it must be sustained by recurrent loops. While it is not clear that this is
essential, this behaviour could be replicated in AI if a network exhibiting attractor dynamics was
used to implement the workspace. In this case, the broadcast mechanism might consist of a leaky
neural integrator whose dynamics have slow timescales such that sustained inputs are required to
place it in a particular state, and in the absence of these sustained inputs it relaxes back to some
baseline state (as in models of decision-making through evidence accumulation). This broadcast
mechanism would generate the top-down signals feeding into each specialised module.

Indicator GWT-4 includes the conditions that the system must use a state-dependent attention
mechanism and that the workspace must be able to compose modules to perform complex tasks by
querying them in succession. For the state-dependent attention mechanism, both VanRullen and
Kanai (2021) and Goyal et al. (2022) propose the use of key-query attention, which is common
in current AI models. A query can be computed from the workspace’s current state, and keys
can be computed for all other modules. The similarity between the workspace’s query and a given
module’s key would be normalised by the similarities across all other modules in order to introduce
competition between modules, and these normalised similarities would determine the degree to
which each module’s value contributes to the net input to the workspace. That is, a standard
key-query attention mechanism would be applied at each timepoint to compute the input to the
workspace in a way that depends on its current state.

The model described here would be able to meet the second part of GWT-4—the capacity to
use the workspace to query modules in succession to perform complex tasks— when it is unrolled
through time because there are computational loops between the workspace and the modules. The
modules receive input from bottom-up sensory input and from a small number of other modules,
but they also receive top-down input from the workspace. This means that, for instance, it is
possible for one module to control others by controlling what is represented in the workspace. The
sequential recruitment of modules by the workspace is within the computational repertoire of the
system, so it could emerge if it is beneficial during training. However, suitable training would be
required for such a system to learn to compose modules in useful ways and to perform complex
tasks, and constructing a suitable training regime may be a significant challenge for implementing
GWT.

#### 3.1.3 Implementing PRM

We now consider how perceptual reality monitoring theory, as a representative computational HOT,
could be implemented in AI. That is, we consider how an AI system could be constructed with indi-
cator properties HOT-1 through HOT-4. Although PRM researchers claim that there are no current
AI systems that meet all of the requirements (Dehaene et al. 2017, Michel & Lau 2021, Lau 2022),
and there have been no implementation attempts that we are aware of, standard machine learning


methods are sufficient for plausible implementations of most elements of the theory. We begin by
considering the implementation of a “quality space”—that is, a space of possible representations
which satisfies the PRM account of the basis of phenomenal qualities—before turning to the core
claim of PRM, that first-order representations become conscious as a result of being represented
as “real” by a higher-order monitoring mechanism.

Indicator HOT-4 states that the system must have sparse and smooth coding generating a “qual-
ity space”. One of the most important features of all DNNs is that each layer endows the model
with a smooth representation space, in which a continuous range of possible activations codes for
the range of possible inputs. The smoothness of these representation spaces is thought to be one
of the primary reasons why they can generalise to novel inputs at test time; even if a novel input
drives a layer into a different activation pattern, this pattern can still be interpreted by subsequent
layers so long as it is within the model’s training distribution (that is, so long as the layer activated
with similar patterns at training time) (Belkin et al. 2018, Bartlett et al. 2021). In fact, there is
evidence that the perceptual representation spaces learned by current DNNs already closely resem-
ble those of the human visual system, meaning their corresponding “quality spaces” might already
be substantially aligned. For instance, Kriegeskorte (2015) finds that the matrix of pairwise dis-
similarities between representations of many visual stimuli in a DNN is closely aligned to what is
observed in neural activity and that there is even a correspondence between successive layers in
the network and the hierarchical organisation of the visual cortex—although more recent studies
have complicated this picture (see e.g. Golan et al. 2020, Lindsay 2021, Bowers et al. 2022).

Standard methods in machine learning can be used to satisfy the condition that representations
be sparse. For example, regularization techniques can enforce sparse representations in DNN
models, by minimising the magnitude of the network’s representations or the mutual information
between inputs and representations (Tishby 2000). Layers that use normalisation functions like
SoftMax, in which higher values suppress lower values in the representation, also increase sparsity.

Indicators HOT-1 and HOT-2 state that the model must contain both first-order perceptual rep-
resentations of sensory data and higher-order representations that assign a measure of reliability
or “realness” to particular first-order representations. To meet these conditions, a vast number of
known deep learning solutions are possible, of which we review a few. Importantly, all of these
solutions share a simple architectural design of two components: (1) a (first-order) neural net-
work takes sensory data and/or top-down signals as input and produces a number of perceptual
representations distributed across a hierarchy of layers (2) in parallel, a series of separate (higher-
order—specifically second-order) neural networks each take a first-order layer’s activations as in-
put and then output a single scalar, representing the probability that the first-order representation
of that layer is veridical. Solutions for meeting the conditions will differ primarily in terms of how
the second-order networks are trained.

If supervision signals are occasionally present that provide the second-order networks with
“ground-truth” about the reliability of first-order representations, then the second-order network
can be trained to estimate the probability of correctness by standard supervised learning. Obtaining
this ground-truth signal may be difficult, but not impossible. For instance, if a source of first-order
representation errors is internal noise in the network, ground-truth can be estimated simply by
averaging noisy first-order representations over time. Another possibility is to obtain ground-truth
by comparing representations of the same percept in different sensory modalities (e.g., verifying


the veracity of a sound using visual feedback) or through movement (e.g., checking if a visual
percept behaves as it should given known motor actions).

If ground-truth is not directly available, the second-order networks can be trained on other
surrogate tasks where the reliability of a signal is an implicit factor in performance. For instance,
second-order networks might try to predict upcoming first-order representations using past ones.
Because externally generated signals are sometimes more predictable than internally generated
signals—a perception of a falling ball is more predictable than a hallucination generated by random
internal noise—when the networks’ predictions have high error, the second-order network can
assign a lower probability to the veracity of the first-order representation. Alternatively, when
imagery is under cognitive control, engaging in imagination can lead to more predictable sensory
consequences (I imagine a pink bear and a pink bear appears) than when it is not (I allow my mind
to wander). Thus the level of effortful control can serve as another internal signal that could train
a reality monitoring system (Dijkstra et al. 2022). In these ways, a second-order network could
learn to use predictability as a cue to “realness” even in the absence of supervision signals. These
methods are closely related to predictive coding, which has already seen applications in modern
deep learning (e.g., Millidge et al. 2022, Oord et al. 2019, Alamia et al. 2023), except that here
the prediction is done across time rather than across layers in a hierarchy.

Other methods of training the second-order network involve thinking of it as a world-model.
For instance, Bayesian methods in deep learning view perception as an inference process, in which
a neural network attempts to infer the values of latent variables that might have generated the data.
For ideal Bayesian inference, these latent variables must be sampled according to their posterior
probability, which is proportional to their prior probability multiplied by their likelihood of having
generated the data under some world model that specifies how latent variables produce sensory
observations. This sort of perspective fits well with PRM; the inference machinery for latent vari-
able values can be seen as producing perceptual first-order representations, while the second-order
networks evaluate the probability that the first-order representations are true.

While Bayesian inference is intractable in general, several approximate methods exist. For
instance, a recent class of models called Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) provide a frame-
work for doing approximate Bayesian inference using modern deep neural networks (Bengio et al.
2021, Bengio et al. 2022), and can even be used to jointly train the inference model (first-order
network) at the same time as the world-model (second-order network) (Hu et al. 2023, Zhang et
al. 2023). This proposed GFlowNet architecture (like other approximate Bayesian inference meth-
ods) is again related to predictive processing theories of consciousness, which state that conscious
percepts are the brain’s best guesses of the latent causes of its own sensory input (Seth 2021). An
important difference in the PRM case, though, is that after the first-order inference system samples
perceptual latent variables, they only become conscious if the second-order world model assigns
them a high enough probability of being veridical, where either a hard or a soft threshold can be
used to produce the “real” tag.

Note that the mechanism described above could also be used to produce internally-generated
conscious experiences in the system. For instance, a top-down imagination module might first
produce a goal (e.g., visualize an apple) and then drive neural activity accordingly in the first-order
network’s sensory and perceptual layers. Following this, the second-order world model would
assign a probability of veracity to this activity. If the imagination module is capable of producing


coherent enough representations in the sensory and perceptual layers, then the second-order model
would assign the signals a “real” tag in the same way as for externally-generated signals, and
the imagined content would be consciously experienced. A similar mechanism may exist in the
brain, as it has been shown that neural activity in sensory regions is similar during imagination
and bottom-up perception and that the degree of similarity correlates with the vividness of the
experience (Dijkstra 2019, Dijkstra 2023).

A final possibility is to learn a world model implicitly through adversarial methods. In partic-
ular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al. 2014) are a class of methods
in which a generator network attempts to sample synthetic data and a discriminator attempts to
differentiate real data from synthetic data produced by the generator. The generator is optimized
to fool the discriminator into predicting its outputs as “real”, with the result that, if the networks
used are powerful enough, the stable solution is for the generator to sample data from the true
data distribution. The discriminator in GANs is comparable to the higher-order monitoring mech-
anism posited by PRM (Lau 2022). A GAN-based implementation of PRM might involve (a) a
first-order perception network that produces perceptual representations given sensory data, (b) a
generator network that inverts this process by first sampling synthetic perceptual representations
and then producing synthetic sensory data given those percepts, and (c) a second-order network
that is trained to discriminate between the real sensory-percept tuples produced by the first-order
network and the synthetic ones produced by the generator (Gershman 2019). Like in the case of
explicit world models, we can subsequently produce the “real” tag of PRM by applying a hard or
a soft threshold to the discriminator’s output given representations from the first-order network.

It now remains for us to consider indicator HOT-3, which concerns the consumer of outputs
from the metacognitive monitoring mechanism. Indicator HOT-3 states that this should be a “gen-
eral belief-formation and action selection system” and that there should be a “strong disposition”
to update it in accordance with the monitoring mechanism’s outputs. There are dual motivations
for this condition: the function of the monitoring mechanism is to serve this consumer, which relies
on the accuracy of first-order representations which are tagged as “real”; and the “force” of these
inputs to the consumer is intended to explain the force and persistence of conscious experiences.

To implement the consumer, we can instantiate one or more higher-level networks that similarly
take only perceptual representations with the “real” tag as input. There might be many ways to
accomplish this, but one possibility is to use standard Transformer architectures for the higher-
level networks with one small adaptation. In the Transformer, one or more query vectors would
be produced by the higher-level network (intuitively representing the current computational goal)
that would then attend to first-order perceptual representations depending on the values of their key
vectors (intuitively representing the “kind” of percept or its “data type”). In a standard Transformer,
each precept would then be modulated based on the similarity between its key and the higher-level
network’s query, and then subsequently integrated into the downstream computation. If we wish
to additionally make use of the “real” tags produced by the second-order networks, we need only
multiply the query-key similarities by the value of the “real” tags for each corresponding percept,
which would allow them to effectively serve as prior masks on which precepts may influence
computations in the Transformer. Importantly, such an architecture is compatible with predictions
made by PRM about the stubbornness of conscious percepts (Lau 2019): even if we arecognitively
aware that a percept is inaccurate (e.g., a phantom pain, or a drug-induced hallucination), we still
have a strong disposition to integrate it into our higher-level reasoning. With this Transformer-


based architecture, conscious experiences cannot be reasoned away. This is because the higher-
level network simply takes the percepts modulated by their “real” tags as input, and has no ability
to change those “real” tags itself.

This proposal focuses on the second aspect of indicator HOT-3 (the “strong disposition”), rather
than the idea that the consumer should be a general belief-formation and action selection system.
Philosophers have various ideas about the features a system would need to have to count as forming
beliefs, but one plausible necessary condition, which may be sufficient in this context, is that the
system engages in instrumental reasoning leading to action selection (see section 2.4.5).

#### 3.1.4 Implementing AST

Two notable studies have implemented simple attention schemas in artificial systems. Wilterson
and Graziano’s (2021) system used reinforcement learning on a three-layer neural network with
200 neurons per layer to learn to catch a ball falling on an unpredictable path. The primary input
to this system was a noisy “visual” array showing the position of the ball. This array included an
“attention spotlight”—a portion of the array with the noise removed—that the system could learn
to move. A natural strategy for solving the task was thus for the system to learn to position the
spotlight over the ball, so that noise in the visual array would not interfere with its ability to track
and catch it. This was facilitated by a second input, an “attention schema” that represented the
current position of the spotlight in the array. Wilterson and Graziano found that this system was
much more successful in learning to perform the task when the attention schema was available,
even though the spotlight remained when the schema was removed.

This very simple system did possess some part of indicator property AST-1, the attention
schema, because it used a representation of an attention-like mechanism to control that mecha-
nism, resulting in improved performance. However, this was not a predictive model, and the atten-
tion spotlight was substantially different from attention itself because it was a simple controllable
feature of the input rather than an internal process with multiple degrees of freedom governing
information flow through the system.

More recently, Liu et al. (2023) tested several different systems employing key-query-value
attention on multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. Their systems involved three main elements:
multi-head attention layers, a recurrent neural network for “internal control” and a policy network.
In the version that they took to most accurately implement an attention schema, the attention layers
were applied to inputs to the system and sent information on to the policy network that generated
actions, with the internal control network both learning to predict the behaviour of the attention
layers and influencing this behaviour. This system performed better than the others, with different
architectures made up of the same components, which were tested on the multi-agent RL tasks.

Compared to Wilterson and Graziano’s system, this system had the advantage of using a learnt
predictive model of attention, rather than having an infallible representation provided as input. It
was still used only for relatively simple tasks in 2D visual environments, and a caveat to this line of
research is that attention in AI is not perfectly analogous to attention as understood by neuroscience
(see Box 3). However, this system does illustrate a route to constructing systems that possess the
attention schema indicator.


#### 3.1.5 Implementing agency and embodiment

The remaining indicators are agency and embodiment. Reinforcement learning is arguably suf-
ficient for agency as we have characterised it (“learning from feedback and selecting outputs so
as to pursue goals”), so meeting this part of indicator AE-1 may be very straightforward. Rein-
forcement learning is very widely used in current AI. To recap the argument for the claim that RL
is sufficient for agency, the basic task in RL is for the system to learn to maximise cumulative
reward in an environment in which its outputs affect not only the immediate reward it receives but
also its opportunities for future reward. RL algorithms are, therefore, designed to be sensitive to
the consequences of outputs, making the system more likely to repeat outputs that lead to greater
reward over multiple time-steps. This means that there is a contrast between RL and other forms
of machine learning. Like systems trained by supervised or self-supervised learning, RL systems
gradually come to approximate a desired input-output function. However, in RL what makes this
the desired function is that the outputs are conducive to goals that can only be achieved by extended
episodes of interaction between the system and the environment. Crucially, RL systems learn these
functions by virtue of their sensitivity to relationships between outputs, subsequent inputs, and re-
wards. Model-based RL systems learn models of these relationships, but model-free systems are
also sensitive to them. So RL systems learn and select actions so as to pursue goals (Butlin 2022,
2023).

The second part of indicator AE-1 says that the probability of consciousness is raised to a
greater degree if systems exhibit “flexible responsiveness to competing goals”. The example mo-
tivating this clause is an animal balancing multiple homeostatic drives: this requires prioritisation
which is sensitive to shifting circumstances. Several computational approaches to this problem
have been explored, including in the context of reinforcement learning (Keramati & Gutkin 2014,
Juechems & Summerfield 2019, Andersson et al. 2019). One proposal is to use multiple modules
that learn independently about how to maximise distinct reward functions, with each of these mod-
ules assigning scores to possible actions, and then to pick the action with the highest total score
(Dulberg et al. 2023). In the homeostatic case, these reward functions might each correspond to
a homeostatic drive, with large penalties for allowing any one of them to depart too far from a set
point.

Our embodiment indicator, AE-2, states that systems should use output-input models (also
known as forward models) for perception or control. There are specific uses of such models,
which neuroscientists have identified in humans, that are particularly associated with embodiment.
In perception, predictions of the sensory effects of the system’s own actions can be used to dis-
tinguish changes to sensory stimulation caused by these actions from those caused by events in
the environment. Systems that engage in this form of inference implicitly or explicitly distinguish
themselves from their environments. In motor control, forward models can be used for state es-
timation and feedback control, enabling rapid adjustments of complex effectors. It is important
to distinguish these uses of output-input models from other uses, such as planning, which do not
imply embodiment.

Learning output-input models for tasks related to perception and control is common, but there
are few examples of current AI systems which meet these specific descriptions. For example, video
prediction is a much-studied task (Oprea et al. 2020), and this includes predicting how visual input
will develop conditional on the system’s outputs (Finn et al. 2016). But this is not sufficient for the
kind of use in perception that we have described, which also includes making sense of exogenous
changes which are not predictable from outputs. Output-input models are used in model-based
reinforcement learning for control, facilitating successful control of quadrotor drones (Becker-
Ehmck et al. 2020) and other robots (Wu et al. 2022). But it is uncertain whether the models are
used in these cases for control-specific purposes rather than for planning, a topic that we explore
further in section 3.2.2.

One good example of recent research which does employ a forward model for a purpose spe-
cific to embodied systems is the system described in Friedrich et al. (2021). In this system,
Kalman filtering (Todorov & Jordan 2002) was used to combine a forward model with sensory
inputs, which were subject to a time delay, in order to estimate the current state of the system in its
environment. These estimates were then used in ongoing motor control, although only of relatively
simple effectors in virtual environments.


### 3.2 Case Studies of Current Systems

#### 3.2.1 Case studies for GWT

In practice, it is not always immediately obvious whether a given AI system possesses one of the
indicator properties. One reason for this is that we have not given absolutely precise definitions
for each indicator. Another is that how deep learning systems work, including what they repre-
sent at intermediate layers, is often not transparent. In this section and section 3.2.2 we present
case studies illustrating the use of the indicators to assess current AI systems. Here we focus on
the GWT indicators (GWT-1 through GWT-4), and on two kinds of systems that are notable for
different reasons. These systems are Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3 (Brown et al. 2020), GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023), and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al. 2022), which
are notable for their remarkable performance on natural language tasks and the public attention
they have attracted; and Perceiver (Jaegle et al. 2021a) and Perceiver IO (Jaegle et al. 2021b),
which are notable because Juliani et al. (2022) argue that they “implement a functioning global
workspace”. Neither of these kinds of systems was designed to implement a global workspace, but
there are arguments to be made that they each possess some of the GWT indicator properties.

Figure 5: The Transformer architecture.

eit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., Kaiser, L., &
Polosukhin, I., 2023. Attention is all you need.

In a Transformer, an operation called “self-
attention” is used to integrate information from
different parts of an input, which are often
positions in a sequence (see Box 3 on atten-
tion; Vaswani et al. 2017). If we see the
elements of the system which process infor-
mation from each position (attention heads)
as modules, then there is a basic similarity
between the Transformer architecture and the
global workspace: both integrate information
from multiple modules. Transformers consist
of a stack of layers of two types, which al-
ternate: layers of attention heads, which per-
form the self-attention operation, moving in-
formation between positions, and feedforward
layers. An interpretation of Transformers by
Elhage et al. (2021) describes them as made
up of “residual blocks”, each consisting of one
layer of each type, which process information
drawn from and then added back to a “residual
stream”.
With the concept of the residual stream in
mind, it is possible to argue that Transformers
possess indicator properties GWT-1 through
GWT-3—that is, that they have modules, a
limited-capacity workspace introducing a bottleneck, and global broadcast. The residual stream


is the (alleged) workspace, and its dimensionality is lower than that of the self-attention and feed-
forward layers which write to it and read from it (Elhage et al. 2021). There is “global broadcast”
in the sense that information in a particular layer in the residual stream can be used by downstream
attention heads to influence further processing at any position. The information which is added to
the residual stream at a given layer also depends on the state of the residual stream at earlier lay-
ers, so on this interpretation one might argue that Transformers meet the state-dependent attention
requirement in GWT-4.

One problem with this argument is that it is questionable whether the dimensionality of the
residual stream constitutes a bottleneck, since it is the same as that of the input to the system as a
whole. However, a more fundamental problem with the argument is that Transformers are not re-
current. The residual stream is not a single network, but a series of layers interspersed between oth-
ers. There are no modules that pass information to the residual stream and receive it back—instead,
when attention heads and feedforward layers combine to write to the residual stream, this affects
only what is received by different attention heads and feedforward layers downstream. One way
to think about this is to ask which parts of Transformers are the modules. If modules are con-
fined to particular layers, then there is no global broadcast. But if modules are not confined to
particular layers, then there is no distinguishing the residual stream from the modules. Transform-
ers lack the overall structure of a system with a global workspace, in that there is no one distinct
workspace integrating other elements. There is only a relatively weak case that Transformer-based
large language models possess any of the GWT-derived indicator properties.

The two versions of the Perceiver architecture, meanwhile, are closer to satisfying the GWT
indicators than Transformers, but in our view still fall short of satisfying them all. The Perceiver
architecture was designed to address a weakness of Transformers, which is that the self-attention
operation integrates positions by generating pairwise interactions. This is computationally expen-
sive to scale to high-dimensional inputs, motivating an approach that uses a single limited-capacity
latent space to integrate information from specialists (Jaegle et al. 2021a, b, Goyal et al. 2022).
In particular, Perceiver IO is designed to handle inputs from multiple domains or modalities, and
to produce outputs of various kinds, using multiple input encoders and output decoders. It uses
self-attention to process information in the latent space, and a related operation, cross-attention,
to select information from input modules and write to output modules. The latent space alternates
between self-attention and cross-attention layers, enabling it to take new information from input
modules repeatedly. Perceiver IO achieves high performance in tasks including language process-
ing, predicting movement in videos, image classification, and processing information about units
for the purpose of action selection in Starcraft II (Jaegle et al. 2021b).


Figure 6: Perceiver architecture.Jaegle, A., Gimeno, F., Brock, A., Vinyals, O., Zisserman, A.,
& Carreira, J., 2021. InProceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning,
PMLR 139:4651-4664. Reprinted with permission.

The Perceiver architecture allows for sequences of inputs to be processed diachronically, with
the latent space state updating with each new input, but also influenced by its previous state. So
Perceiver arguably possesses indicator properties GWT-1 (specialised modules) and GWT-2 (bot-
tleneck), as well as the first part of GWT-4 (state-dependent attention). However, it is notable that
while specialised modules are possible in the architecture, they are not mandatory—the Perceiver
can be used with one input network with a single function. Also, more importantly, the number
of inputs that can be processed sequentially is limited by the number of cross-attention layers in
the latent space. This means that although attention in Perceiver is state-dependent, in practice the
system must be reset to begin a new task, so its states are determined by previous inputs on the
current task.

As in the case of Transformers, the clearest missing element of the global workspace in the
Perceiver is the lack of global broadcast. Perceiver IO has multiple output modules, but on any
given trial, its inputs include an “output query”, which specifies what kind of output is required.
So only one output module acts on information from the workspace. Furthermore, input modules
do not generally receive information from the workspace. So while the Perceiver architecture is
important as an example of the successful use of a workspace-like method to improve functionality
in AI, it is some way from being a full implementation of GWT.

#### 3.2.2 Case studies for embodied agency

We now consider examples of AI systems that illustrate what is required for indicators AE-1 and
AE-2, which concern agency and embodiment. The systems we discuss in this subsection are:
PaLM-E (Driess et al. 2023), described as an “embodied multimodal language model”; a “vir-
tual rodent” trained by RL (Merel et al. 2019); and AdA, a large Transformer-based, RL-trained
“adaptive agent” (DeepMind Adaptive Agents Team 2023).


Figure 7: PaLM-E architecture.Driess, D., Xia, F., Sajjadi, M. S. M., Lynch, C., Chowdhery,
A., Ichter, B., Wahid, A., Tompson, J., Vuong, Q., Yu, T., Huang, W., Chebotar, Y., Sermanet, P.,
Duckworth, D., Levine, S., Vanhoucke, V., Hausman, K., Toussaint, M., Greff, K., & Florence,
P., 2023. PaLM-E: An embodied multimodal language model.arXiv:2303.03378. Reprinted with
permission.

PaLM-E is a decoder-only LLM (Driess et al. 2023), fine-tuned from PaLM (Chowdhery et
al. 2022). It takes encoded multimodal strings which can include both text and images as input,
and produces text tokens as output. Like other LLMs, it can be used autoregressively to produce
extended strings of text. Its use requires an encoder, and in combination with a suitable encoder,
it can perform well in both pure language tasks and vision-language tasks such as visual question
answering. However, PaLM-E can also be combined with a separately-trained policy unit that
maps natural-language instructions and visual context to low-level robot actions. The PaLM-E
study used policies from Lynch et al. (2022) which were trained to imitate human control of robot
actuators. In this setup, the system can take input from a camera, combine it with task instructions
provided by a human, and generate and execute plans for action. PaLM-E generates high-level
plans while the policy unit provides low-level vision-guided motor control. If necessary, the plan
can be updated later based on new observations.

In considering Palm-E, we can focus on several different systems: the PaLM-E model itself,
the policy unit, or the complete system comprised of these two elements and the robot they control.

The complete system is very naturally described as an embodied agent. When given tasks,
it can make plans and execute them by moving its robotic “body” through spaces it shares with
humans. However, both of the main components of the system are trained, in effect, to imitate
human behaviours. PaLM-E is trained by self-supervised learning to predict the next token in
human-generated strings, and the policy unit is trained to imitate human visuomotor control. So
the system arguablyimitatesplanning and using visuomotor control to execute plans, as opposed
to actually doing these things. It does not learn to pursue goals from feedback about success or


failure.

Since the complete system includes a robot, it is natural to describe it as embodied. However,
according to the account we have adopted, for a system to have an embodied perspective it must
model how its outputs affect the environment in order to distinguish itself from the environment in
perception or to facilitate motor control. It is hard to see how the complete PaLM-E system could
have learnt a model of this kind, given that it is not trained end-to-end and has, therefore, not been
exposed to the effects of its outputs on the environment in the course of training. The components
are also trained in environments in which there is little or no exogenous change, so the need to
learn to disambiguate sources of change in input is absent.

Perhaps the best case to be made for embodiment here focuses on the policy unit. This is a
Transformer-based network trained to map from video and text to continuous actions in imitation
of human control. In human motor control, a forward model (mapping outputs to predicted inputs)
is used to generate expectations for comparison to intentions and sensory inputs so that move-
ment trajectories can be corrected in real time (McNamee & Wolpert 2019). This may involve
distinguishing the self from the environment, since exogenous events may be responsible for mis-
matches. Something like this mechanism might in principle be used by the policy unit because the
input to the network includes some observation history. This means that it could learn to detect a
mismatch between the observations it would have predicted given past states and those it is now
receiving and correct its actions accordingly. For example, if it is instructed to push a block East
and observes that the block is moving North as it acts, this could prompt a correction.

It could also be argued that the policy unit is an agent, even though it is not trained by RL. It can
learn sequences of inputs that are associated with progress towards a goal, specified by another part
of the input, and adjust its outputs so as to generate these sequences. However, it is questionable
whether this is enough for agency because although the system learns about sequences of inputs
and about which outputs to produce when confronted with these sequences, it does not learn how
its outputs affect inputs – so it cannot produce outputs because it expects them to help to generate
the right sequences. A similar objection can also be made against the case for embodiment: the
system can learn to detect “mismatches” between past and present observations in the context of a
task, but not between past observations and actions, on the one hand, and present observations on
the other. This is not to say that the policy unit definitively lacks agency and embodiment but to
illustrate the kinds of considerations that are relevant to these issues.

Given that controlling an avatar in a simulated environment can be enough for embodiment,
the “virtual rodent” of Merel et al. (2019) is a promising candidate for these attributes. It is trained
by RL, which is sufficient for agency. This system was constructed by implementing a virtual
“body” with 38 degrees of freedom based on the anatomy of laboratory rats. A recurrent LSTM-
based actor-critic architecture was trained end-to-end by RL to control this body, using rich visual
and proprioceptive inputs, to perform four tasks in a static 3D environment. This architecture is
plausibly sufficient for the system to learn a model of how its outputs affect its inputs which it could
use in perception and action. Because recurrent networks are used, new inputs can be processed in
the context of stored representations of inputs and outputs from the recent past. So the system can,
in principle, process inputs and select outputs in the context of expectations generated from its past
behaviour—that is, in the context of outputs from a self-model, which would (perhaps implicitly)
represent information about stable properties of its body.


However, in this study, the environment did not change exogenously, and it appears the tasks
could have been solved by producing combinations of a set of stereotyped movements, such as
running, jumping and rearing. The analysis indicates that the system did learn a repertoire of
behaviours like these. These movements may not need ongoing control from perceptual feedback.
This raises a question about whether the task demands were sufficient to cause the system to learn
to use a self-model rather than a relatively simple input-output policy.

AdA, DeepMind’s “adaptive agent”, is also trained end-to-end by RL to control an avatar in a
3D virtual environment (DeepMind Adaptive Agents Team 2023). The system consists of a Trans-
former which encodes observations at the past few hundred timesteps (the exact figure varied in
the team’s experiments), including past actions and rewards as well as task instructions and sen-
sory input and feeds into an LSTM which is trained to predict future actions, values and rewards.
This system was trained on a very wide range of tasks, of increasing difficulty, in order to cause
it to undergo meta-RL. This meant that it learnt an implicit online learning algorithm, allowing it
to learn to perform new tasks from observations in its memory—the Transformer encoding recent
past timesteps—without updating weights. After this training regime, the system was able to adapt
to new tasks in its environment at human timescales.

AdA is a significantly more powerful system than the virtual rodent, although it controls a much
less complex avatar. Its environment is somewhat less stable, including because some of the tasks
it performs involve cooperating with another agent, but the emphasis is on learning to generate
and test behavioural strategies for new tasks, rather than on coordinating complex dynamics. So
again we could question whether the system faces the kinds of challenges that seem to have been
responsible for the evolution of self-modelling in animals. However, unlike the virtual rodent,
it has a specific training objective to generate predictions based on past sequences of interleaved
inputs and outputs. AdA may, therefore, be the most likely of the three systems we have considered
to be embodied by our standards, despite not being physically embodied (like PaLM-E) or being
trained primarily for motor control of a complex avatar (like the virtual rodent).


## 4 Implications

In this final section, we discuss the topic of consciousness in AI in a broader context. We consider
risks from under- and over-attribution of consciousness to AI systems (in section 4.1) and the
relationship between consciousness and AI capabilities (in section 4.2). We also make some limited
recommendations, in section 4.3. Our comments in this section are brief—the main aim of this
report is to propose a scientific approach to consciousness in AI and to establish what current
scientific theories imply about this prospect, not to investigate its moral or social implications.

### 4.1 Attributing Consciousness to AI

There are risks on both sides of the debate over AI consciousness: risks associated with under-
attributing consciousness (i.e. failing to recognize it in AI systems that have it) and risks associated
with over-attributing consciousness (i.e. ascribing it to systems that are not really conscious). Just
as in other cases of uncertain consciousness, such as other animals (Birch 2018) and people with
disorders of consciousness (Peterson et al. 2015; Johnson 2022), we must consider both types of
risk.

#### 4.1.1 Under-attributing consciousness to AI

As many authors have noted, as we develop increasingly sophisticated AI systems we will face
increasingly difficult questions about their moral status (Bryson 2010, Gunkel 2012, Schwitzgebel
& Garza 2015, 2020, Metzinger 2021, Shulman & Bostrom 2021). Philosophers disagree about the
exact relationship between being conscious and moral status, but it is very plausible that any entity
which is capable of conscious suffering deserves moral consideration. If we can reduce conscious
suffering, other things being equal, we ought to do so. This means that if we fail to recognise the
consciousness of conscious AI systems we may risk causing or allowing morally significant harms.

An analogy with non-human animals helps to illustrate the issue. Humans mistreat farmed
animals in very large numbers, motivated by powerful economic incentives. Whether or not this
mistreatment depends on a failure to attribute consciousness to these animals, it illustrates the po-
tential problem. In the case of AI, there is likely to be considerable resistance to attributions of
consciousness, partly because developers of AI may have powerful economic incentives to down-
play concerns about welfare. So if we build AI systems that are capable of conscious suffering, it
is likely that we will only be able to prevent them from suffering on a large scale if this capacity
is clearly recognised and communicated by researchers. However, given the uncertainties about
consciousness mentioned above, we may create conscious AI systems long before we recognise
we have done so.

An important point in this context is that being conscious is not the same as being capable
of conscious suffering. It is at least conceptually possible that there could be conscious systems
that have novalencedoraffectiveconscious experiences—that is, no experiences that feel good
or bad to them (Carruthers 2018, Barlassina & Hayward 2019). If it is only valenced experiences
that have special moral significance, then the key question for establishing the moral status of AI


systems is whether they are capable of such experiences (that is, whether they are sentient, as
this term is sometimes used). We have not discussed neuroscientific or philosophical theories of
valence or otherwise investigated the prospects of specifically valenced conscious experience in
AI systems. Theories of valenced conscious experience are less mature than theories of visual
experience, suggesting an important priority for future work. However, we suspect that many
possible conscious systems which are also agents will have valenced experiences since agents
must evaluate options in order to select actions.

In short, the risk of under-attributing consciousness should be taken seriously. Failing to recog-
nise conscious AI systems as such could lead us to cause unwarranted suffering to many conscious
beings.

#### 4.1.2 Over-attributing consciousness to AI

There is also a significant chance that we could over-attribute consciousness to AI systems—indeed,
this already seems to be happening—and there are also risks associated with errors of this kind.
Most straightforwardly, we could wrongly prioritise the perceived interests of AI systems when
our efforts would better be directed at improving the lives of humans and non-human animals. As
Schwitzgebel and Garza (2015, 2020) argue, uncertainty about the moral status of AI systems is
dangerous because both under- and over-attribution can be costly.

Over-attribution is likely because humans have a well-established tendency to anthropomor-
phise and over-attribute human-like mental states to non-human systems. A growing body of work
examines the tendency of people to attribute consciousness and agency to artificial systems, as
well as the factors influencing this attribution (Dennett 1987, Gray & Wegner 2012, Kahn et al.
2006, Krach et al. 2008, Sytsma 2014). There may be various reasons for humans to have an
“agent bias”—a natural inclination to ascribe agency, intentions, and emotions to non-human enti-
ties—stemming from our evolutionary history (Guthrie 1993).

One possibility is that we might anthropomorphise AI systems because it seems to help us to
understand and predict their behaviour—although this impression could be false, with anthropo-
morphism in fact causing us to make incorrect interpretations. Anthropomorphism allows us to
understand and anticipate complex systems like AI using the same cognitive frameworks we use
for understanding humans, potentially helping us navigate interactions with AI (Epley et al., 2007).
Dennett postulates that individuals employ a cognitive strategy, called the “intentional stance”, to
predict and explain the behaviour of various entities, including humans, animals, and artificial sys-
tems (Dennett 1987). The intentional stance involves attributing mental states, such as beliefs,
desires, and intentions, to an entity to decipher and anticipate its behaviour. Observation and inter-
action with AI systems often lead to the natural adoption of the intentional stance, especially when
their behaviours appear purposeful or goal-directed. This tendency is further amplified when AI
systems exhibit human-like characteristics, such as natural language processing, facial expressions,
or adaptive learning capabilities (Mazor et al. 2021). Researchers have identified several factors
that predispose individuals to anthropomorphise AI systems, including their physical appearance,
behaviour, and perceived autonomy (Kahn et al. 2006; Złotowski et al. 2015).

Attributions of agency and consciousness to artificial agents may also be driven by an emo-
tional need for social interaction (Mazor et al. 2021). Individuals who seek social interaction and


fulfillment from artificial systems may be more prone to attributing consciousness to them. As-
signing human-like traits to AI can help people cope with difficult emotions or situations, such
as feeling more comfortable confiding in an AI that appears empathetic or understanding (Turkle
2011). The use of artificial systems such as Replika chatbots as sources of social interaction is
already evident.

The recent rapid progress in language model capabilities is particularly likely to drive over-
attribution of consciousness, as the case of Blake Lemoine arguably illustrates (Lemoine 2022).
Modern LLMs can convincingly imitate human discourse, making it difficult to resist the impres-
sion that one is interacting with a conscious agent, especially if the model is prompted to play the
role of a person in a conversation (Shanahan et al. 2023).

In addition to the risk of misallocation of resources which we mentioned above, over-attributing
consciousness to AI systems creates risks of at least three other kinds. First, if consciousness is
sometimes attributed to AI systems on weak grounds, these attributions may undermine better-
evidenced claims of consciousness in AI. Observers of debates on this topic may recognise that
some attributions are weak, and assume that all are. This effect could be particularly powerful if
there are also reasonable concerns that attributions of consciousness to AI are distracting us from
addressing other pressing problems. Second, if we judge that a class of AI systems are conscious,
this should lead us to treat them differently—training them in different ways, for instance. In
principle, this could conflict with work to ensure that AI systems are developed in ways that benefit
society. And third, overattribution could interfere with valuable human relationships, as individuals
increasingly turn to artificial agents for social interaction and emotional support. People who do
this could also be particularly vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation.

Whatever one’s views about the relative importance of these various risks, they amount to a
powerful case for research on the prospect of consciousness in AI. If the development of AI is to
continue, this research will be crucial: it is risky to judge without good grounds either that no AI
systems can be conscious, or that those of a particular class are conscious.

### 4.2 Consciousness and Capabilities

In the popular imagination, consciousness is associated with free will, intelligence and the tendency
to feel human emotions, including empathy, love, guilt, anger and jealousy. So our suggestion that
conscious AI may be possible in the near-term might be taken to imply that we will soon have
AI systems akin to the very human-like AIs depicted in science fiction. Whether this in fact fol-
lows depends on the relationships between consciousness and other cognitive traits and capacities.
Furthermore, conscious AI systems are more likely to be built if consciousness is (or is expected
to be) associated with valuable capabilities in AI. So in this subsection, we briefly consider how
consciousness might be related to differences in AI systems’ behaviour and capabilities.

One possible argument for the view that we are likely to build conscious AI is that conscious-
ness is associated with greater capabilities in animals, so we will build conscious AI systems in
the course of pursuing more capable AI. It is true that scientific theories of consciousness typically
claim that conscious experience arises in connection with adaptive traits, selected for the contribu-
tions they make to cognitive performance in humans and some other animals. For example, Baars


(1988, 1997) claims that the global workspace “optimizes the trade-off between organization and
flexibility” (1988, p. 348), a trade-off that advanced AI systems must also presumably manage.

A weakness of this argument is that human and animal minds are not necessarily a good guide
to the connection between consciousness and capabilities in artificial systems. This is because the
“design” of animal minds is explained not only by the adaptive value of our capabilities but also by
the constraints under which we evolved, which include limits on the quantity and form of data from
which we can learn; limits on the amount of energy available to power our minds; and the forms of
our ancestors’ minds and the availability of relevant mutations. The space of possible designs for
AI systems is different from the space of possible mind designs in biology (Summerfield 2022).
So we may well find ways to build high-performing AI systems which are not conscious.

However, some influential AI researchers are currently pursuing projects that aim to increase
AI capabilities by building systems that are more likely to be conscious. We have already discussed
the ongoing work by Bengio and colleagues which uses ideas from GWT. Goyal and Bengio (2022)
write that:

```
Our aim is to take inspiration from (and further develop) research into the
cognitive science of conscious processing, to deliver greatly enhanced AI,
with abilities observed in humans thanks to high-level reasoning.
```
The aim here is to build AI systems that implement at least some of the features underlying
consciousness in humans, specifically in order to enhance capabilities. Similarly, LeCun’s pro-
posed architecture for autonomous intelligence has features such as a world model for planning
and a “configurator”, described as an element that “takes inputs from all other modules and con-
figures [the other modules] for the task at hand” (LeCun 2022, p. 6). LeCun also suggests that
the existence of elements like these in the human brain may be responsible for what he calls “the
illusion of consciousness”. These are examples of a widespread and long-established practice in
AI of drawing on insights from the cognitive sciences (Hassabis et al. 2017, Zador et al. 2022).
So regardless of whether building in consciousness-associated features is the only possible route
to greater capabilities, it is one that we are likely to take.

Turning now to the issue of how conscious artificial systems are likely to behave, there are both
conceptual and empirical reasons to doubt that being conscious implies having human-like motives
or emotions. Conceptually, to be conscious is simply to have subjective experiences. In principle,
there could be conscious subjects who had experiences very unlike ours. In particular, there is no
apparent conceptual incoherence in the idea of motivationally neutral conscious experiences which
lack valence or affect—and even if a conscious subject does have valenced or affective states, these
may be triggered by different circumstances from those which trigger our emotions, and motivate
them to behave in different ways.

Empirically, the theories of consciousness we have discussed do not generally claim that con-
sciousness implies human-like motives or emotions. One exception is the view that consciousness
is only possible in the context of self-maintenance, which we discussed in section 2.4.5, since
this presumably entails not only that conscious beings engage in self-maintenance, but that they
are motivated to do so. But this view is an outlier. Some theories, such as GWT and PRM, sug-
gest that conscious subjects must be agents and perhaps that their desires are likely to enter into


conscious experience—in GWT, the workspace maintains representations that provide important
context for processing in the modules, and current desires might fit this description. But these the-
ories are neutral about what motivates conscious subjects. AST is a somewhat more complicated
case: Graziano (2013) argues that the use of an attention schema is important for social cognition
because it allows one to model attention either in oneself or in others. He further claims that this
is a reason to build conscious AI because AI systems with attention schemas will be capable of
empathy (Graziano 2017). But the claim here seems to be that implementing AST is necessary for
attributing conscious states to others, and, therefore, for being motivated by empathy to help them,
not that consciousness is sufficient for empathetic motives.

Many current concerns about the impacts of AI do not turn on whether AI systems might
be conscious. For example, the concern that AI systems trained on data that reflects the current
structure of society could perpetuate or exacerbate injustices does not turn on AI consciousness.
Nor does the concern that AI could enable various forms of repression, or that AI systems could
replace human workers in most jobs (although the economic value of replacing human workers
may motivate capabilities research which leads to conscious AI, as we have noted). Perhaps most
surprisingly, arguments that AI could pose an existential risk to humanity do not assume con-
sciousness. A typical argument for this conclusion relies on the premises that (i) we will build AI
systems that are very highly capable of making and executing plans to achieve goals and (ii) if we
give these systems goals that are not well chosen then the methods that they find to pursue them
may be extremely harmful (see e.g. Hilton 2022). Neither these premises nor the ways in which
they are typically elaborated and defended rely on AI systems being conscious.

### 4.3 Recommendations

Several authors have made important practical recommendations concerning the possibility of AI
consciousness. These include: Bryson’s (2010) case that conscious AI should be avoided; Met-
zinger’s (2021) call for a moratorium on work that could lead to conscious AI; Graziano’s (2017)
arguments in favour of conscious AI; Schwitzgebel and Garza’s (2020) argument that we should
only build particular AI systems if we can either be confident that they will be conscious, or be
confident that they will not be; and the detailed recommendations of Bostrom and Shulman (2022).
We have not assessed the arguments for these recommendations and do not consider them further
here.

However, we do recommend support for research on the science of consciousness and its appli-
cation to AI (as recommended in the AMCS open letter on this subject; AMCS 2023), and the use
of the theory-heavy method in assessing consciousness in AI. One way that we can make progress
in learning which AI systems are likely to be conscious is by developing and testing scientific the-
ories of consciousness; theoretical refinements within the existing paradigms are valuable, as well
as attempts to test predictions of competing theories, as in the ongoing Cogitate adversarial col-
laboration (Melloni et al. 2021). A second is by undertaking careful empirical research to extend
theories of consciousness to non-human animals. This will help us to establish a more general ac-
count of the correlates of consciousness, based on evidence from a wider range of cases (Andrews
& Birch 2023). And a third is research that refines theories of consciousness specifically in the
context of AI. Research of this kind may involve theorising about AI implementations of mecha-


nisms implicated in theories of consciousness; building such systems and testing their capacities;
identifying ambiguities in existing theories; and developing and defending more precise formula-
tions of theories, so that their implications for AI are clearer. Integrating work of this kind with
continued empirical research on human and animal consciousness can be expected to be especially
productive.

Two other lines of research may be important. One is research specifically on valenced and
affective consciousness; if conscious experience of this kind is especially morally important, as
seems to be the case, then we have a pressing need for well-founded computational theories which
can be applied to AI. The other is efforts to develop better behavioural tests for consciousness in
AI. Although our view is that the theory-heavy approach is currently the most promising, it may
be possible that behavioural tests could be developed which are difficult to game and based on
compelling rationales, perhaps informed by theories. If such tests can be developed, they may
have practical advantages over theory-heavy assessments.

As we learn more about consciousness, and gain better tools to assess whether it may be present
in AI systems, we must also use these tools effectively. That means applying the theory-heavy
method as we develop new kinds of AI systems, both prospectively—in assessing the likelihood
of consciousness in planned systems, before we build them—and retrospectively. In retrospective
evaluation, methods for mechanistic interpretability may be important, since it is possible that
systems that do not have potentially consciousness-supporting features built in could acquire them
in the course of training. It also means that scientific theories should be central to consciousness-
related AI policy and regulation.

```
Box 4: Open questions about consciousness in AI
```
```
This report is not the last word on AI consciousness. Far from it: one of our major aims is to
spur further research. Further progress in the neuroscience of consciousness will contribute
to our understanding of the conditions for consciousness in AI, and we have suggested that
research on consciousness in non-human animals may be particularly valuable. Here, we
highlight research questions that are relevant for understanding AI consciousness in partic-
ular.
Refining and extending our approach
While following the same basic approach as this report, further research could:
```
- Examine other plausible theories of consciousness, not considered in this report, and
    use them to derive further indicators of consciousness;
- Refine or revise the indicators which we have derived from the theories considered
    here;
- Conduct assessments of other AI systems, or investigate different ways in which the
    indicators could be implemented.

```
Furthermore, our approach could be extended by developing a formal evaluation procedure
for consciousness that could be applied to AI systems, although it is questionable whether
```

this would be justified at present, in the context of significant uncertainty about computa-
tional functionalism and about particular scientific theories.

Computational functionalism and rival views
Determining whether consciousness is possible on conventional computer hardware is a dif-
ficult problem, but progress on it would be particularly valuable, and philosophical research
could contribute to such progress. For example, sceptics of computational functionalism
have noted that living organisms are not only self-maintaining homeostatic systems but are
made up of cells that themselves engage in active self-maintenance (e.g. Seth 2021, Aru et
al. 2023); further work could clarify why this might matter for consciousness. Research
might also examine whether there are features of standard computers which might be incon-
sistent with consciousness, but would not be present in unconventional (e.g. neuromorphic)
silicon hardware. A further topic for philosophical research is the individuation of AI sys-
tems, given that they can be copied, distributed, called in multiple places at once, and so
forth.

Valence and phenomenal character in AI
We have set aside the question of whatkindsof experiences conscious AI systems might
have. In principle, these could be quite different from human experiences. An important
issue is what it would take for AI systems to be capable of having valenced conscious ex-
periences—that is, ones that feel good or bad—because these might have special moral
significance. Research on computational theories of valence would help to address this is-
sue.

AI interpretability research
A significant obstacle for the theory-heavy approach is our limited understanding of the
inner workings of complex deep learning systems. AI interpretability research seeks to illu-
minate and explain these workings, and can, therefore, contribute to many forms of research
on AI, including research on consciousness.

Behavioural tests and introspection
Although we have stressed the limitations of behavioural tests for consciousness in AI, we
are open to the possibility that compelling tests could be developed, so research towards this
end may be valuable. Behavioural tests need not be “theory-neutral”, but could be based
on specific scientific theories. Another possible approach is to develop AI systems with
reliable introspective capacities that could allow them to meaningfully report on their own
consciousness or lack thereof (Long forthcoming).

The ethics of research on AI consciousness
On balance, we believe that research to better understand the mechanisms which might
underlie consciousness in AI is beneficial. However, research on this topic runs the risk
of building (or enabling others to build) a conscious AI system, which should not be done
lightly. Mitigating this kind of risk should be carefully weighed against the value of better
understanding consciousness in AI.
